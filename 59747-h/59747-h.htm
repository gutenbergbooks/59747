<p>While Little Eagle waited patiently in front
of the tepee of Clawing Bear, the medicine
man, several of his friends went past. Each of
the boys was carrying a bow and arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your bow,&rdquo; Angry Wolf called. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
having a shooting match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking a lesson from Clawing Bear,&rdquo;
he explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can take lessons every day when we
are in winter camp,&rdquo; Angry Wolf pointed out.
&ldquo;Today Roaring Lion is giving some fine
arrows as prizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. Roaring Lion
was one of the best makers of arrows in
the whole Sioux nation. One of them
would be a prize worth more than a lesson.
Little Eagle knew that there was little chance
he could win one of the arrows. He was about
the poorest shot among the boys in the camp.
Still, this time luck might be with him. Certainly
it was too good a chance to miss. He
started to get to his feet to go with Angry
Wolf, but changed his mind and sat down
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have promised to take a lesson,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well,&rdquo; Wounded Face spoke
up. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t win a prize anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle jumped angrily to his feet.
He&rsquo;d show Wounded Face that he could win
a prize. But before he had taken the second
step toward his own tepee, Little Eagle realized
that this was no way for a Sioux to act.
If he expected to become a great warrior and
medicine man, he must keep the promises he
made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my promise,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>Little Eagle squatted again in front of the
tepee while Angry Wolf and Wounded Face
went on. It seemed a long time before Clawing
Bear called for him to come into the tepee.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle stepped inside, Clawing
Bear had a pot of grease simmering over a
tiny fire. The medicine man motioned for
Little Eagle to sit at one side of the fire.</p>
<p>Little Eagle tried to keep his mind on what
Clawing Bear was doing, but his thoughts
wandered to where the other boys were shooting
at the slender target set up for them. He
could almost see himself splitting the target
while Wounded Face missed. He leaned forward,
trying to make his mind and his eyes
follow Clawing Bear&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>Abruptly the medicine man stepped away
from the fire. He turned quickly, and his
burning glance made Little Eagle&rsquo;s eyes meet
his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;I try to teach you the wisdom of Sioux
medicine men,&rdquo; Clawing Bear growled, &ldquo;and
your mind wanders off to where other boys
are shooting for prizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle dropped his eyes guiltily. Truly
Clawing Bear had looked into his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he apologized, and then added
with conviction, &ldquo;I can mix the poultice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it then,&rdquo; Clawing Bear ordered, upsetting
the bowl with his foot so that the contents
spilled onto the fire. A dense cloud of
biting smoke filled the tepee.</p>
<p>Little Eagle waited until some of the smoke
had seeped out at the top of the tepee before
he got to his feet. He pulled the bowl from
the fire and set it aside. He selected another
bowl, put grease in it, and set it on the fire.
He began to add powdered herbs which he
took from the bags Clawing Bear had hanging
on the wall of the tepee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Clawing Bear had seated himself and was
watching Little Eagle&rsquo;s every move. Little
Eagle carefully selected the materials to go
into the bowl. He hesitated as he reached for
the powdered herb in a large bag. At first he
took a handful, but he changed his mind and
dropped only a pinch into the bowl. He
stirred the mixture until it began to boil.
When he glanced toward Clawing Bear, he
saw a look of approval on the medicine man&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You nearly missed,&rdquo; Clawing Bear said
gruffly. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard for a boy of twelve
summers to study when other boys are playing.
There will be no more lessons today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using two sticks as tongs, Little Eagle lifted
the bowl off the fire. His eyes moved from the
bowl back to the fire as though they had been
drawn by a magnet. He gave a little gasp as,
in the leaping flames, he seemed to see a party
of Crow warriors riding swiftly. He tried to
count them, but they went too fast. As the
Crows appeared to fade away in the fire, Little
Eagle became aware that Clawing Bear was
speaking to him. He tried to collect his
scattered wits so that he could answer respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be a better pupil,&rdquo; he
promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow you will think about becoming
a warrior and a hunter,&rdquo; Clawing Bear answered
sadly. &ldquo;Learning the arts of a Sioux
medicine man is more important, but you
won&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle moved toward the flap of the
tepee. In a moment Clawing Bear would make
the sign of dismissal. There might still be
time to race to the tepee, get his bow and
arrows, and join the contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Clawing Bear ordered. &ldquo;You have
done better than I expected. As a reward, you
may carry some of the poultice with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle tried to keep his face from
showing the pleased surprise he felt. A real
warrior or a real medicine man would have
given no sign of pleasure. He watched as
Clawing Bear picked up a small bag made
from the lining of a deer&rsquo;s stomach. The
medicine man filled it with the mixture from
the bowl. Then he took a sack made of soft
elk leather and placed the bag of ointment
inside the leather sack. He tied the sack with
a long thong. He made a knot in the ends of
the thong so that the sack would hang at Little
Eagle&rsquo;s belt in the place where a tomahawk
would hang when Little Eagle became a warrior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you have learned today may save
some Sioux&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; Clawing Bear told him
solemnly.</p>
<p>Little Eagle tried to find the right words
to thank the medicine man. There were words
which he should speak, but his tongue
couldn&rsquo;t say them. A brief smile touched the
lips of the medicine man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care for words,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let
your deeds thank me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clawing Bear gravely made the sign of dismissal,
but Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t scamper out
of the tepee. Instead he stepped out slowly
as a warrior would have stepped out of the
council wigwam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>When he had gone a few paces, he remembered
the other boys. He turned quickly toward
his own tepee. He had covered about
half of the distance when a commotion near
the council wigwam attracted his attention.
He turned to look. There was a crowd of
warriors near the entrance to the wigwam. A
party of Crow chiefs in splendid headdresses
was going slowly toward the entrance. Little
Eagle had been so busy with his lessons that
he had forgotten this was the day for the powwow
between the Crow chiefs and the chiefs
of his own tribe to start.</p>
<p>Little Eagle stood watching the Crows as
they filed into the wigwam. He thought of
how bitterly he hated these enemies of his
people. Reluctantly, he admitted to himself
that the Crow chiefs were brave. The Sioux
chiefs had promised them safety while they
were in the Sioux camp, but who knew when
a young man, anxious to become a warrior,
would ambush them on the way to or from
their own camp?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Little Eagle&rsquo;s glance swept over the camp.
He saw that there was no real danger to the
Crow chiefs. The Sioux dog soldiers had
formed a circle around the camp. It was the
duty of the dog soldiers to see that camp
orders were obeyed. Ordinarily they did little
except when they were with a war party or a
hunting party. However, now they would see
to it that no Sioux left the camp until the
Crow chiefs had had time to return to their
own camp. Little Eagle was surprised that the
teacher and the boys had been allowed to
leave camp for the contest. Then he saw that
they hadn&rsquo;t. They were standing with the warriors,
watching the Crows.</p>
<p>Little Eagle started toward them, but
changed his mind. He remembered that
strange sight he had seen in Clawing Bear&rsquo;s
fire. Those Crow warriors he had seemed to
see had been shown to him as a sign. It was
a warning. The Crows didn&rsquo;t really want to
make peace. They were planning treachery.
Flying Wolf, the chief in charge of the Sioux
camp was letting the Crows lead him down a
blind path. Little Eagle turned and hurried
to his own tepee.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle came out of his tepee,
he had his bow and quiver of arrows in his
hand. He turned toward the land-of-the-setting-sun.
In that direction there were low hills
covered with small trees and thickets of brush.
Little Eagle had no plan for getting past the
dog soldiers he could see pacing back and forth
along the top of the hill. He hoped a plan
would come to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The Sioux camp had been pitched at the
base of the hills along the river. There were
two rows of tepees, each row forming an arc.
When Little Eagle reached the tepee in the
second row, he stood near it to watch the dog
soldiers. He saw that the dog soldier at the
nearest post was Laughing Horse, one of
the youngest warriors in the band.</p>
<p>Little Eagle noticed that while Laughing
Horse walked his beat steadily, as a good dog
soldier should, he often looked toward the
river. Little Eagle turned and looked in that
direction to see what was attracting the dog
soldier&rsquo;s attention. He grinned to himself
when he saw that the squaws and young
women were working at buffalo hides. Undoubtedly
Summer Flower was among them.
Laughing Horse was trying to catch sight of
the young woman to whom he was paying
court. At any other time Little Eagle would
have raised a derisive shout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Little Eagle turned his attention back to
Laughing Horse. He watched closely to see
how often the dog soldier glanced toward the
camp, how often he looked toward the land-of-the-setting-sun,
and how often he glanced
toward the women. As he watched, Little
Eagle kept count of time by slowly folding
and unfolding his fingers. He soon knew how
long the dog soldier looked in each direction.</p>
<p>Little Eagle tensed himself. The moment
Laughing Horse&rsquo;s back was turned, Little
Eagle made a running dive for the nearest
clump of shrubs. While he was running, Little
Eagle was folding and unfolding his fingers
as he had done while he was watching the dog
soldier. There was a little more time left before
Laughing Horse would turn toward the
river. Little Eagle used that time to wriggle
farther into the shrubs.</p>
<p>Little Eagle continued to fold and unfold
his fingers, keeping time to Laughing Horse&rsquo;s
movements. He didn&rsquo;t raise his head until the
count on his fingers told him that Laughing
Horse should again be looking toward the
land-of-the-setting-sun. When that time came,
Little Eagle raced across the open space to
the next clump of shrubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Slowly he made his way up the hill. Near
the top, the shrubs were thicker. While these
gave Little Eagle better cover, he had to move
carefully so that he didn&rsquo;t brush against one
of them. Laughing Horse&rsquo;s mind might be on
the girl at the riverbank, but he wouldn&rsquo;t
miss the quiver of a stem of brush if Little
Eagle touched one.</p>
<p>As he saw the sun climbing steadily into
the sky, Little Eagle began to worry. It was
taking him much longer to get out of camp
than he had planned. Still, he must go carefully.
If a dog soldier saw him, his whole plan
would be spoiled, and Little Eagle well knew
that a warrior was not invited to become a dog
soldier until he had proved himself more
capable than most warriors.</p>
<p>The sun was almost straight overhead by
the time Little Eagle reached a point close to
the line along which Laughing Horse walked.
Little Eagle held his breath while the dog
soldier passed so close that Little Eagle could
have reached out and touched him. As soon
as Laughing Horse passed, Little Eagle crept
across to the other side of the hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>There were more trees on this side. With
them to hide him, Little Eagle was able to go
faster. Yet it seemed a long, long time before
he reached the tree-lined creek where he was
out of sight of the dog soldiers.</p>
<p>As soon as he was sure he was safe, Little
Eagle got to his feet and started off at a brisk
walk. He would have liked to run, but he
knew the sharp ears of a dog soldier might
catch the thud of running feet. He walked
until he was far enough up the next hill so
that there was a chance the dog soldiers could
see him. Here he crouched down and crawled,
slipping from bush to bush until he was across
the hill and safely out of sight of the guards.</p>
<p>As he hurried along, Little Eagle grew more
and more uneasy. It had taken him a long
time to get away from camp. It might take
him even longer to discover the treacherous
plan that the Crows were making. It seemed
almost as though there was a voice whispering
in his ear: &ldquo;Hurry, hurry! Danger, danger!&rdquo;
He began to run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Little Eagle had been taught the proper
pace to use to go swiftly on a long journey.
It was an easy trot which he could keep up
all day. But the warning voice seemed to be
urging him to go faster and faster. The
thought of danger to his tribe was like a lash,
driving him on. Little Eagle ran faster and
faster until he was driving himself as hard as
he could go.</p>
<p>He ran until he was gasping for breath and
had to slow to a walk. He wanted to sit down
and rest, but he forced himself to go on. He
walked until he was breathing more easily,
although his legs were still trembling from
overexertion. He looked about for a place
where he could hide and rest.</p>
<p>He was crossing a wide strip of prairie where
there were no trees or shrubs behind which he
could hide. He saw a place where rain had
washed a gully in the hillside. When he turned
to it, he found it was a narrow gully with
heavy grass overhanging its sides. He crawled
into it and stretched out flat. The grass hid
him so well that anyone might pass within a
few paces without seeing him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>When he felt rested, Little Eagle started to
get to his feet. His ears caught the sound of
pounding feet. Someone was running toward
him from the direction of the camp. Little
Eagle guessed that some dog soldier had found
his trail and was following him. He should
have known that he couldn&rsquo;t escape them. He
fought down the impulse to raise his head and
look. Instead he stretched out and remained
as quiet as possible.</p>
<p>He could hardly believe it when he heard
the footsteps go on past and fade out in the
distance. It was strange that the dog soldier
had followed his trail this far and then failed
to see where he had turned aside. When Little
Eagle finally raised his head, whoever had
gone by was out of sight.</p>
<p>Little Eagle went back to his own trail.
There were a few bits of dry grass which
hadn&rsquo;t straightened. He sensed that something
wasn&rsquo;t as it should be. He knelt down to get a
better look. There were no signs of anyone
else having followed his trail. Yet he knew
he had heard someone running past. He
hunted about until he found another trail
several paces to the right of the one he had
made. Whoever had been running in this
direction had not been following him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Again Little Eagle knelt to get a better
look. He saw that the strides taken were not
much longer than his own. The warrior who
had passed must not be a large man, but Little
Eagle could not tell whether the man had
been a Sioux or a Crow. He wished Clawing
Bear or a warrior were with him. They would
have been able to read all of the signs.</p>
<p>Little Eagle hesitated. He glanced toward
the land-of-the-rising-sun, then he turned and
took a long look in the other direction. At
last he made up his mind. He ran several paces
to his left and again started toward the land-of-the-setting-sun.</p>
<p>This time he went at a sensible pace. He
ran at a jogging trot, occasionally slowing to
a walk. The sun was still high in the sky when
he came to the place where the Crow camp
should be. He began to go as cautiously as he
had when he slipped out of his own camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>When Little Eagle saw smoke rising into
the air across the hill ahead of him, he knew
he was almost upon the Crow camp. There
didn&rsquo;t seem to be any Crow watchers on this
side of the hill. Nevertheless, he moved carefully.
The Crows might have dog soldiers
around the camp. Near the top of the hill,
Little Eagle got to his hands and knees and
crawled forward.</p>
<p>The top of the hill was covered with brush
and trees, so it was easy for him to keep
hidden. He could hear the sounds of the camp
ahead. He crawled forward until he came to
a place where the hill sloped steeply down
into a valley. He found a clump of brush to
hide behind. From there he could look down
onto the Crow camp with little danger that a
warrior would see him.</p>
<p>As Little Eagle studied the camp, it seemed
as though his suspicions had been wrong.
There were no more than the agreed twenty-five
warriors in it. As nearly as he could tell,
the warriors were loafing, waiting for the
chiefs to come back from the powwow.</p>
<p>Although everything in the camp appeared
to be as it should be, Little Eagle still hesitated.
The suspicions in his mind were hard
to put aside. But at last he decided to return
to his own camp. There was nothing to show
that the Crows weren&rsquo;t keeping their agreement.
He had made that long run, and taken
the chance of being punished by the dog soldiers,
all for no purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/i2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="717" />
<p class="caption"><i>A warrior rode into camp from the other side</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>He was starting to move back when a warrior
rode into camp from the other side. The
other warriors sprang up and surrounded the
rider. Little Eagle stopped. He could tell that
excited talk was going on in the camp, but
he was too far away to hear it. He couldn&rsquo;t
even catch the meaning of the signs made by
some of the speakers. It did seem odd that the
rider didn&rsquo;t dismount. The man talked only
a short time to the warriors before he turned
his horse and rode out of camp the way he
had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The whole affair was baffling to Little Eagle.
He had a strong feeling that something was
wrong, yet he had no idea what it was. He
shook his head. And then suddenly he knew
the answer. The messenger had come only a
short distance, otherwise he would have exchanged
his horse for a fresh one before starting
the return journey. There was another
party of Crows near! Here was proof that they
were planning treachery. They had agreed to
have only twenty-five warriors on the disputed
land until after the powwow. That rider was
proof there was another band near. The only
purpose for having that other band near would
be to make a surprise attack on the Sioux
camp.</p>
<p>Little Eagle knew he had to get back and
report what he had learned. Slowly he inched
his way backward until he was far enough
down the hill that he dared get to his feet.
Even then he slipped from tree to tree. It
wasn&rsquo;t until he was at the bottom of the hill
that he realized he didn&rsquo;t have enough information
to take back to camp. Some of the
Sioux were so anxious to believe the Crows
wanted peace that they would have another
explanation for the rider. No, he would have
to see the other Crow camp before he could
convince his own leaders.</p>
<p>Little Eagle continued away from camp
many paces before he turned to go around it.
He made a circle wide enough so that there
was no longer danger he would be discovered.
He continued the circle until he came to the
trail made by the rider. At a jogging trot, he
turned to follow it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The sun was alarmingly far down the western
sky. However, Little Eagle had learned
his lesson, and he held himself to a steady trot.
While he was sure this other Crow camp was
near, it would still be a long trip back to the
Sioux camp. He took some comfort from
the knowledge that the Crows wouldn&rsquo;t make
an attack before daybreak. By that time he
should have his proof and be back to report
to his chiefs.</p>
<p>When he heard the sounds of the camp
ahead of him, Little Eagle used every skill he
knew to move silently. He reached a place
from which he could see the other Crow camp.
He saw it was much larger than the first one.
His eyes sparkled angrily. Here was the proof.
This was a camp of many warriors, probably
as many as five camps like the first one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>If there had been any doubt in his mind as
to the plans of the Crows, activities in the
camp below would have erased them. Many
of the warriors were busily repairing bows and
other fighting equipment. Others were painting
their faces with war paint. Little Eagle
gave a grunt of anger. While they were pretending
to make peace, the Crows were actually
getting ready to make an attack. Little
Eagle could see that if this band of Crows
succeeded in surrounding the Sioux camp,
not a Sioux would escape.</p>
<p>Little Eagle had to get the warning back
to his own people. Somehow he would make
the chiefs listen to him. As he tensed his muscles
to start to move back, he could feel danger
around him like the chill of a cold wind. This
wasn&rsquo;t danger from the Crow camp. This was
close at hand. Before he could move to defend
himself, someone dropped onto his back. He
was pinned helplessly to the ground, and a
hand was clamped tightly over his mouth.
Little Eagle forgot his own danger in the
bitter thought that he had failed his tribe.</p>
<p>His captor leaned close and whispered into
Little Eagle&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle&rsquo;s heart gave a tremendous
bound of relief. The voice was that of Angry
Wolf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c2">CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<p>Little Eagle carefully inched his way back
from the top of the hill. He knew Angry Wolf
was moving back too, but there wasn&rsquo;t the
whisper of a sound to tell him where his friend
was. When he was several paces down the hill,
Little Eagle rose to a stooping position so he
could go faster. He darted from tree to tree.
He was in the thick growth of trees at the foot
of the hill when Angry Wolf hissed softly to
call his attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Little Eagle looked around. He finally saw
Angry Wolf hidden in some thick brush. Little
Eagle crawled in beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait here to make sure no one is
following us,&rdquo; Angry Wolf whispered.</p>
<p>They lay silently in their hiding place while
dusk faded into darkness. At last Angry Wolf
touched Little Eagle&rsquo;s shoulder to let him
know it was time to move. Little Eagle stepped
in Angry Wolf&rsquo;s footsteps as the other boy led
the way from the Crow camp. Angry Wolf
went on until they were many paces from the
Crow camp. When he stopped, he listened
carefully for signs of enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing away from our camp,
Little Eagle?&rdquo; he demanded as sternly as
though he were a dog soldier.</p>
<p>A sharp answer rose to Little Eagle&rsquo;s tongue.
Angry Wolf was only a summer older than he,
and he hadn&rsquo;t yet earned the right to be called
a warrior. He had no right to speak to Little
Eagle in that tone of voice. Little Eagle choked
back an angry answer when he realized that
it was anxiety and excitement that made Angry
Wolf speak so sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;I felt there was something wrong about
the powwow,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered. &ldquo;I came
to see if the Crows were planning treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been better for our party if
our chiefs had been as suspicious,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf agreed gloomily. &ldquo;I slipped out of camp
because I too, thought the Crows could not
be trusted. Now we must get a warning back
to our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a long trip,&rdquo; Little Eagle reminded
him. &ldquo;If we had horses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too dangerous to try to take horses
from this Crow camp,&rdquo; Angry Wolf replied.
&ldquo;If we failed, there would be no one to take
a warning to our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy Otter is in charge of the dog soldiers,&rdquo;
Little Eagle said. &ldquo;He will be angry
when he learns that both of us slipped through
the lines. He may have us punished and not
listen to our reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will have to listen to us,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
protested. &ldquo;If our camp isn&rsquo;t warned, it will
be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Happy Otter will be too angry to listen,&rdquo;
Little Eagle insisted. &ldquo;However, if we rode
Crow horses into camp, he would have to take
us to the chiefs to explain why we took horses
when our chiefs had promised to have peace
until the powwow was over. That would give
us a chance to tell about this camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; Angry Wolf agreed. &ldquo;We
must have at least one horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry Wolf led the way farther from the
Crow camp. He went on until they were so
far from the camp that they could no longer
hear the noise made in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; he announced when they
stopped. &ldquo;You return to our camp. If I fail
to get a horse, you still may reach our camp
in time. When the dog soldiers arrest you,
demand to be taken to Clawing Bear. Everyone
knows you are a pupil of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle saw the wisdom of Angry Wolf&rsquo;s
plan. It did seem that since he was the one
who had thought of taking a Crow horse, he
should be the one to try it instead of Angry
Wolf. Yet the plan for Little Eagle to demand
to be taken to Clawing Bear was good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a long journey to our camp,&rdquo; Little
Eagle said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The two boys had been sitting down as
they talked. Now Little Eagle got to his feet.
Before he took the first step, Angry Wolf
grabbed his ankle. Little Eagle felt the warning
pressure of Angry Wolf&rsquo;s fingers. He stood
like a statue. He caught the sound of horses
coming from the direction of the Crow camp.
A moment later two mounted Crow warriors
could be seen in the starlight.</p>
<p>Little Eagle checked the impulse to duck
down. Many times it had been explained to
him that by remaining motionless he would
be safer. The sudden movement of ducking
out of sight was more apt to be seen than a
person standing quite still. He waited until
the two Crows disappeared in the direction
of the other Crow camp. Angry Wolf hadn&rsquo;t
released his hold on Little Eagle&rsquo;s ankle. He
increased the pressure to let Little Eagle know
that he thought they should make a new plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two Crows are great warriors,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf whispered. &ldquo;They have been sent
to keep watch during the night between our
camp and the other Crow camp. They will
make your trip far more dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Little Eagle wondered how Angry Wolf
knew so much about the two Crow warriors.
He had had only a brief look at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will keep a sharp watch,&rdquo; Little Eagle
promised. &ldquo;I will be careful not to walk into
an ambush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry Wolf shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crow warriors may be anywhere between
our camp and that other Crow camp,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The only chance is to ride through on a
horse. It would be better if you helped me
get a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle kept the smile of triumph from
his face. Now they would use the plan that he
had thought wisest from the first. Both of them
would sneak to the Crow horse corral and each
would take a horse. One of them would get
away and take the warning to the Sioux camp.
His mind turned back to the question that
had been bothering him since they had seen
the two Crow warriors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know those two Crows were
great warriors?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the belts they wore,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
answered. &ldquo;They had trophies of many successful
raids.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Little Eagle was ashamed that he hadn&rsquo;t
noticed the belts. Truly, if he were to become
a great warrior or a great medicine man, he
would have to learn to watch more closely.
When Angry Wolf got to his feet and started
back toward the Crow camp, Little Eagle
followed willingly. Angry Wolf had proved
that he should be the leader.</p>
<p>Not the sharpest ear could have heard the
two young Sioux as they went back to their
hiding place at the top of the hill above the
Crow camp. Before he put a foot down, Angry
Wolf looked carefully to see that there was no
twig to snap under his step. Little Eagle made
sure that he stepped in the other boy&rsquo;s tracks.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle looked down onto the
Crow camp, he saw that it still was as busy
as it had been earlier. As the two boys watched,
the warriors finished their work with their
fighting equipment. The fires were allowed
to die down to beds of glowing coals. It looked
as though the warriors were ready to roll up
in their blankets and sleep until it was time
to make their attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Little Eagle saw several warriors leave the
camp and go toward the horse corral. At first
he thought they were merely going to look
at their horses. He felt the icy finger of fear
when he saw the men returning to camp,
leading their horses. Evidently the Crows
weren&rsquo;t going to wait until dawn to make their
attack. Little Eagle and Angry Wolf wouldn&rsquo;t
have time to take a warning back to camp.
Little Eagle glanced toward Angry Wolf.
Angry Wolf signaled that they should move
back.</p>
<p>Hopelessly, Little Eagle obeyed the signal.
Halfway down the hill, Angry Wolf stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horses will be tied to the wrists of
their owners tonight,&rdquo; Angry Wolf explained.
&ldquo;We must think of a plan to get one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Little Eagle felt as though a weight had
been lifted from his shoulders. Of course that
was what the Crow warriors were doing. He
had heard of this custom of the Crows. The
night before a Crow warrior went into battle,
he slept with his horse&rsquo;s long tether tied to
his wrist. The Crows believed that while the
owner slept, his spirit talked to the horse. In
that way, the horse would know just what to
do when the battle started. Little Eagle was
so relieved to know there was still a chance
to get a warning back to his own camp, that
he could hardly wait to make the attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be other horses in the corral,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It would be easier to get one of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get a horse from the corral, it might
be one that wasn&rsquo;t much good,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
answered. &ldquo;The best horses will be tied to
the owners&rsquo; wrists. I must get one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle wanted to protest that both of
them should try to get horses, but he remained
silent. Angry Wolf was the one who had remembered
the Crow custom of keeping horses
in camp the night before a battle. He had
proved himself capable to be the leader. Little
Eagle must obey him until he, too, proved
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Angry Wolf stretched out full length upon
the ground. He seemed to be unworried about
this expedition. He took a piece of dried meat
from a leather sack at his belt. He broke the
chunk of meat in two and offered a piece to
Little Eagle. Little Eagle hesitated. He was
ashamed that he had forgotten another lesson
their warrior-teacher had taught all of the
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you leave camp, be sure to take
food with you,&rdquo; the teacher had told them
many times. &ldquo;Sometime you may be hiding
near enemies where you don&rsquo;t dare hunt for
food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was another way in which Angry Wolf
had proved himself more nearly a warrior than
Little Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; Angry Wolf urged. &ldquo;We will
need all of our strength to do what must be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle took the food. While he ate, he
stretched out beside Angry Wolf. His muscles
relaxed. Almost the moment he swallowed the
last of the food, he fell asleep. He was awakened
by the pressure of Angry Wolf&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Little Eagle waited until he was sure that
he was wide awake before he sat up. Angry
Wolf gave a little tug on his arm to signal
Little Eagle to follow. They made their way
back to the top of the hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The campfires still cast some light about
the camp. Occasionally a burning branch
would break in two, sending up a flickering
light. Little Eagle could see that there was a
horse near every tepee. The campfires didn&rsquo;t
give off enough light for him to see the thongs
which tied the horses to their masters, but he
knew they were there.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf leaned so close that his lips
were almost against Little Eagle&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I can get a horse,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
whispered. &ldquo;If I fail, you must find a way to
get the warning back to our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a horse,&rdquo; Little Eagle whispered
confidently.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf waited until he was sure no one
was moving about the camp. He disappeared
so silently that Little Eagle was hardly aware
that he was leaving.</p>
<p>Little Eagle turned all of his attention to
the Crow camp. He held his breath when he
saw a Crow warrior step out of one of the
tepees. He let his breath out in a sigh of relief
when the warrior turned and went back into
the tepee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>It was a long time before Little Eagle
caught the faint shadow of another movement
in the camp. He knew it must have been Angry
Wolf darting between two campfires. Little
Eagle watched anxiously for the quick movement
of a horse which would betray Angry
Wolf to their enemies. Slowly and silently,
Little Eagle moved his bow to a shooting position
and fitted an arrow to the string.</p>
<p>He saw one of the horses take a couple of
steps and thought that must be the one Angry
Wolf had selected. The horse moved a few
more steps and then stopped. Little Eagle almost
shouted a cry of warning as a Crow warrior
stepped out of a tepee near the horse.
There was enough light from the glowing
campfire for Little Eagle to see the warrior
start toward the horse, but there the man
faded into the shadows. It was a long, anxious
time before the Crow again came into view
in front of the tepee. The warrior hesitated
a moment before he went inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Little Eagle put every effort into watching.
He was sure that Angry Wolf would leave that
horse and try to take another. Little Eagle
turned his head, looking from one tepee to
the next. Finally he saw another horse moving
slowly away from a tepee. The horse took a
few steps and stopped. It continued this slow
pace as it moved toward the edge of the camp.
When the horse passed between two campfires,
Little Eagle couldn&rsquo;t see Angry Wolf,
but he was sure his Sioux friend was pressed
against the horse&rsquo;s other side.</p>
<p>The horse made slow progress. It walked
slowly and it stopped often. At last there was
only one more campfire for it to pass and it
would be out of the light. Little Eagle&rsquo;s heart
leaped into his throat as he saw a Crow warrior
step out of a tepee. Evidently Angry Wolf
had seen the Crow too, because the horse
stopped and remained standing.</p>
<p>Slow moment followed slow moment. Little
Eagle found that he was breathing as hard as
though he had run a great distance. At last
the warrior reached his hand toward the tepee
flap and started to go back in. At the same
instant the horse took a couple of quick, sidling
steps. The Crow warrior whirled around.
His warning yell rang through the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/i3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="724" />
<p class="caption"><i>Mounted Crow warriors were in pursuit</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Since he could no longer hope to stay
hidden, Angry Wolf sprang onto his horse&rsquo;s
back. He drummed his heels against the animal&rsquo;s
side and sent it racing out of camp.
Warriors sprang from tepees as though they
had been waiting for a signal. Before Angry
Wolf had more than started up the hill,
mounted Crow warriors were in pursuit.</p>
<p>For a moment Little Eagle forgot that most
of the Crow camp was riding toward him. He
jumped to his feet to watch Angry Wolf. He
remembered his own danger and crouched
down out of sight. He tried to get a shot at
the pursuing Crows, but in the darkness and
among the trees, he had no chance. He
watched helplessly as some of the warriors
gained rapidly on Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>Little Eagle wondered why the warriors
didn&rsquo;t shoot. They were within easy bowshot
of Angry Wolf. He knew the answer almost
as quickly as he thought of the question. As
long as they had a chance to surround Angry
Wolf, they wouldn&rsquo;t take the risk of an arrow
wounding a Crow horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Angry Wolf reached the top of the hill and
started down the other side. His horse was
running harder, and the gap between him
and his pursuers began to widen. As the Crow
warriors dashed past, Little Eagle sprang up.
The warriors were so intent on the chase that
there was no danger they would look back.
Little Eagle raced after them as though he
expected to overtake the horses. The riders
reached the bottom of the hill, crossed the
narrow valley, and started up the other side.
Little Eagle&rsquo;s hopes began to rise. Angry Wolf
was getting farther ahead at every jump of his
horse.</p>
<p>Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t see the arrow fly, but
he did see Angry Wolf topple from his horse.
The horse kept running, and the Crows went
after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll catch the horse before they come
back to take Angry Wolf&rsquo;s scalp,&rdquo; Little Eagle
thought to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>There was no time to make a plan. Little
Eagle kept running toward the place where
Angry Wolf had fallen. He hadn&rsquo;t any idea
how he would do it, but he must hide Angry
Wolf from the Crows. A Sioux who went to
the Happy Hunting Grounds without his
scalp could never be happy there.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle reached Angry Wolf, he
crouched over his friend. He had been so sure
that the Crow&rsquo;s arrow had killed Angry Wolf
that he gave a grunt of unbelieving surprise
when he found that Angry Wolf still breathed.
The deep, bloody gash along Angry Wolf&rsquo;s
head warned Little Eagle that there was little
hope of saving the other&rsquo;s life. Yet, since he
was still alive, there was a chance.</p>
<p>Little Eagle raised his head and paused to
listen. He could hear the sounds of the Crows
still chasing the runaway horse. He had a little
time. He got Angry Wolf&rsquo;s arm across his
shoulder and somehow got to his feet. Half
carrying and half dragging the wounded boy,
Little Eagle started away from the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>He went on until he was gasping for breath.
Although it seemed that he had been struggling
under that weight for a long time, Little
Eagle knew he had gone only a few paces from
the trail. But he could go no farther. As gently
as possible, he lowered Angry Wolf to the
ground. Again he bent over Angry Wolf, and
again he was relieved to find that the boy still
breathed.</p>
<p>The only plan which occurred to Little
Eagle seemed to have small chance of succeeding,
but it was better than not trying at all. He
picked up a small branch. Holding this in
both hands, he walked backward, brushing the
limb back and forth across his trail. It wasn&rsquo;t
a good job of erasing his tracks, but it might
keep the Crows from finding them until after
daylight.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle reached the place where
Angry Wolf had fallen, he stretched out on
the ground. He heard a triumphant yell which
meant that the Crows had caught the horse.
They soon would be coming back. Little Eagle
was careful to make plain marks to make it
appear that Angry Wolf had struggled to his
feet. He started from the trail in the direction
opposite to that in which he had taken Angry
Wolf. He took as long strides as he could, and
at first, staggered about. He wanted to convince
the Crows that they were following the
trail of a wounded warrior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>He had gone only a short distance when he
heard the sounds of the Crows returning. He
began to go faster. Whenever he neared a
clump of brush, he went directly toward it. He
knew the Crows would stop and send warriors
to surround the clump before they went near
it. They would take no chance of having a
wounded warrior ambush them. Each of these
delays would give him a chance to lead them
farther from Angry Wolf before he himself
was captured.</p>
<p>Little Eagle heard an angry yip. The Crows
had returned and found that the enemy,
whom they had supposed slain, had slipped
away. Little Eagle increased his speed. It
wouldn&rsquo;t be long until the Crows found his
trail and came in pursuit. He knew they
would come slowly. They were sure that the
enemy they were pursuing was badly wounded.
They wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid the enemy would escape.
Their only fear would be that he might
ambush them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>A series of short, sharp yells told him that
they had found his trail. He could almost see
them following it. A couple of trackers on foot
would follow the trail. Mounted warriors
would ride at each side of the trackers and behind
them. The riders would turn aside to
surround each of the clumps of brush toward
which he had made his trail.</p>
<p>When he started, Little Eagle&rsquo;s one plan
had been to lead the Crows away from Angry
Wolf. As he realized that he was getting farther
away from his pursuers, he began to
change the plan. There was a small hope that
he might escape and get back to Angry Wolf.
His hand brushed against the bag of poultice
Clawing Bear had tied at his belt. If he could
get back to Angry Wolf, there might be a
chance to save the wounded boy&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Little Eagle had thought he was going as
fast as it was possible for him to go. As the
hope of saving Angry Wolf&rsquo;s life grew, he
somehow managed to go faster. He heard the
gurgle of running water ahead of him. When
he pushed through a clump of small trees, he
saw the stream. He knew this was the creek
that twisted among the low hills near the
Crow camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Little Eagle saw that he could take a short
run and jump across the creek. He ran as
though this were his plan, but he shortened
his leap and landed in the water. He stopped
to listen. He had gained so much on his pursuers
that he could hardly hear them. He
smiled to himself when he remembered something
the warrior-teacher had told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have to hide from your enemies,&rdquo;
the teacher had said several times,
&ldquo;hide as near them as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of turning downstream, Little Eagle
turned the other way. This route would take
him near the Crow camp. Although the water
was cold, Little Eagle waded up the stream.
There would be no tracks here for the Crows
to follow. He was quite near the Crow camp
when he heard the warriors yelling behind
him. He listened long enough to make sure
they had found the place where he had
jumped into the creek. He felt certain they
would look downstream for him. He climbed
out of the stream at a place where the Crows
had been bringing their horses to water. Even
if the Crows looked for the trail here, it would
be lost among the many other tracks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>As soon as he left the water, Little Eagle
trotted along the bank until he was many
paces past the Crow camp. Here he started a
great circle which took him around the camp
and back upon the ridge on which he had left
Angry Wolf. From the spot where he reached
the top of the ridge, he was still a considerable
distance from Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>Little Eagle went as cautiously as a warrior
would have gone. Although he had heard no
more sounds of the Crows, it was still possible
that they had found Angry Wolf. If they had,
they would be waiting in ambush. Even when
he reached a place from where he could see
Angry Wolf stretched on the ground, Little
Eagle moved slowly, stopping often to look
and listen.</p>
<p>At last he was sure there were no Crows
near. Little Eagle crawled the remaining distance
to Angry Wolf. He gave a grunt of dismay.
Angry Wolf had thrown one arm across
his chest. Little Eagle could see no sign of the
wounded Sioux&rsquo;s chest rising and falling as it
would do if he still breathed. Little Eagle bent
forward until his face was almost against
Angry Wolf&rsquo;s mouth. He felt Angry Wolf&rsquo;s
breath blowing faintly against his face. Angry
Wolf was still alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Little Eagle looked at the deep gash along
the side of Angry Wolf&rsquo;s head. It had been
bleeding badly. Even now a trickle of blood
was running from the wound. It looked as
though Angry Wolf had already lost so much
blood that his life couldn&rsquo;t be saved. But the
very first lesson Little Eagle had learned from
Clawing Bear was that as long as a person
breathed there was hope of saving his life.</p>
<p>Little Eagle opened the pouch at his belt
and took the wad of ointment into his hands.
He kneaded it with his fingers until it was soft
and pliable. If there had been a place near
where he could get water, he would have
washed the wound before applying the poultice.
However, the creek was many dangerous
steps away, and there was no time to lose. As
gently as possible, Little Eagle spread the soft
mass along the wound. He held it in place
until the flow of blood completely stopped. He
nodded in satisfaction when he took his hand
off the poultice and it stayed in place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Little Eagle bent over Angry Wolf&rsquo;s face.
His friend still breathed. Now there was nothing
Little Eagle could do except wait. He
could see the sun beginning to build its campfires.
Already there was a little light in the sky
where the sun would rise. It wouldn&rsquo;t be long
until the Crow warriors returned unless they
had ridden straight on to the Sioux camp.</p>
<p>It was almost daylight when Little Eagle
heard the Crows returning. He would have
liked to jump up and give the Sioux victory
cry. If the Crows were returning this soon,
they had given up their plan to attack the
Sioux camp.</p>
<p>Little Eagle scarcely dared hope that the
Crows would fail to find Angry Wolf and himself.
He told himself it really didn&rsquo;t matter.
He had saved the rest of the Sioux tribe by
outwitting the big party of Crows. Truly he
had won a great victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c3">CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<p>Little Eagle was ashamed of the way his hands
trembled as the sound of the returning Crows
came nearer. He had trouble fitting an arrow
to his bow. He heard the Crows stop at the
place where Angry Wolf had fallen. Now that
it was daylight, the Crows were sure to find
the trail he had made when he had dragged
Angry Wolf away. He couldn&rsquo;t fight off the
whole Crow party, but he would take some
of the Crow warriors with him when he and
Angry Wolf went to the Happy Hunting
Grounds. He hardly believed his ears when he
heard the Crows riding on toward their own
camp. They had missed his trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Little Eagle warily scouted around. When
he returned to Angry Wolf&rsquo;s side, he was sure
that all the Crows had ridden into camp. He
noticed that Angry Wolf was feebly running
his tongue across his lips. There had been no
time for Little Eagle to remember how badly
a wounded person needed water. He thought
of the long distance to the creek. There was
the added danger that at any moment Crow
warriors might return to search for them. Yet
Angry Wolf must have water.</p>
<p>Little Eagle picked up the bag in which he
had carried the poultice. It would hold so little
water that it scarcely seemed worth while to
take the risk to fill it. Then he remembered
the pouch in which Angry Wolf had carried
meat. Little Eagle untied it from Angry
Wolf&rsquo;s belt. The two sacks together would
hold enough water to do some good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Little Eagle started directly toward the
creek, but when he reached a point opposite
the Crow camp, he turned toward it. He
crawled to a place where he could look down
upon the camp. The warriors were gathered
in a circle, talking earnestly together. Little
Eagle couldn&rsquo;t hear their words, but he could
tell from their attitude that they were disputing
some plan.</p>
<p>He watched the gestures of each warrior
who spoke. From the motions they made,
Little Eagle learned that the dispute was about
the Sioux who had escaped. Most of the warriors
seemed to believe that the Sioux had
been able to take a message to the Sioux camp.
A few warriors made motions to indicate the
ground near their own camp. These were the
ones who thought the wounded enemy must
be hiding near by.</p>
<p>Little Eagle saw that the Crows had reached
an agreement, but there was no way for him to
tell what the agreement was. When he saw two
warriors mount horses and ride up the hill
toward him, it looked as though the decision
had been made to search near the camp. He
was puzzled to see a third warrior come up the
hill on foot. The two mounted warriors sent
their horses racing along the trail which led to
the other Crow camp. The warrior on foot
selected a tall tree and started to climb it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;The riders are going to urge the other
camp to hurry away, and the one climbing the
tree is to keep watch,&rdquo; Little Eagle thought to
himself.</p>
<p>While the warrior was giving all of his attention
to climbing the tree, Little Eagle
slipped toward the stream. When he had gone
a few steps, he was in a thick growth of trees
where there was little danger that the lookout
could see him.</p>
<p>When he had the bags filled with water,
Little Eagle hesitated. He almost decided to
cross the stream and circle the Crow camp
again in order to take a safer way back, but the
memory of Angry Wolf licking his lips
made Little Eagle determine to take the
shorter route. He had to walk carefully, avoiding
not only twigs which might snap under his
feet but also limbs and brush which might
shake if he touched them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>When Little Eagle was near the tree the
Crow warrior had climbed, he redoubled his
caution. At first he couldn&rsquo;t see the Crow, but
when the warrior moved to look in another
direction, Little Eagle saw him. Folding and
unfolding his fingers, as he had done when he
slipped out of his own camp, Little Eagle
timed the movements of the Crow lookout. As
soon as he knew it was safe, he darted across an
open space to the shelter of another clump of
bushes.</p>
<p>Here he got to his hands and knees. He
crawled forward, making sure that he touched
nothing which would move and betray him.
As he crawled past the tree, Little Eagle&rsquo;s heart
thumped so wildly that he thought the Crow
must surely hear it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until he had crossed the trail and
was in the shelter of the trees on the other side
that Little Eagle felt safe. He hurried on to
Angry Wolf&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Little Eagle took the smaller bag and let
a few drops of water fall on Angry Wolf&rsquo;s lips.
Angry Wolf ran his tongue across his lips and
opened his mouth. Little Eagle poured water
into Angry Wolf&rsquo;s mouth. He was vastly relieved
when Angry Wolf swallowed without
choking.</p>
<p>After Angry Wolf had been given water, he
seemed to breathe more strongly. It wasn&rsquo;t
long until he began to lick his lips again.
When Little Eagle gave him more water, he
swallowed it easily.</p>
<p>As there was nothing more he could do for
Angry Wolf for a while, Little Eagle crawled
back to the place where he could watch the
lookout in the tree and the Crow camp. He
had scarcely settled himself in his watching
place when the Crow warrior started scrambling
down the tree. The moment the warrior
touched the ground, he went racing toward
the Crow camp.</p>
<p>Little Eagle turned to look at the camp. It
was no longer a camp. The tepees had been
taken down and loaded onto pack horses. All
of the horses were in a close-packed herd, with
warriors holding them. As the lookout ran
down the hill, he waved at the warriors. Immediately
the Crows sprang on their horses
and started toward the land-of-the-setting-sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>One warrior stayed behind, holding his own
horse and that of the lookout. As soon as the
lookout reached the horses, both warriors
mounted and started after the others. There
was a puzzled frown on Little Eagle&rsquo;s face as
he watched the Crows. What was the meaning
of this sudden flight?</p>
<p>Little Eagle was still looking at the place
where the Crows had ridden from sight when
he heard more riders coming from the direction
of the other Crow camp. He recognized
the two leading horses in the band as those he
had seen ridden out of camp a short time
before. He saw that this band of Crows was
the one that had been taking part in the pow-wow.
The warriors were riding so hard that
Little Eagle was sure there was a band of Sioux
in close pursuit.</p>
<p>The Crows dashed down the hill, rode out
onto the trail left by the other band, and went
on. As soon as the Crows were out of sight,
Little Eagle stood up to look back in the direction
from which the Crows had come. Every
moment he expected to see a party of Sioux
warriors dash toward him. The Crows had
been so anxious to get away that it seemed certain
someone was pursuing them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Little Eagle waited eagerly, but there was
no sign of his friends. At last he thought to do
what he should have done earlier. He stretched
out on the ground and put his ear down. He
could hear no sound of hoofbeats. The Crows
had ridden so far that he couldn&rsquo;t hear them,
nor could he hear any sound of approaching
Sioux. Disappointedly, he turned back toward
Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>When he reached Angry Wolf, Little Eagle
had to bend over the wounded Sioux to make
sure he still breathed. He gave Angry Wolf
more water and then sat down to try to make a
plan. When he had seen the Crows fleeing so
hurriedly, he had been sure that Sioux were
close behind them. He could have stopped the
Sioux and someone would have gone to get
Clawing Bear to help take care of Angry Wolf.
But now he knew the Sioux weren&rsquo;t coming.
If Angry Wolf&rsquo;s life was to be saved, he must
have help. But how could he get help?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Little Eagle bent over to look at the poultice
on Angry Wolf&rsquo;s wound. He was dismayed
to see that a few drops of blood were seeping
through the poultice. It should be replaced
with a new one, but Little Eagle had used all
of his material. He knew then that his only
chance to save Angry Wolf was to go to the
Sioux camp and get Clawing Bear to help.</p>
<p>Little Eagle immediately began preparations
for his trip. He raked up leaves which he
put over Angry Wolf, leaving only his face uncovered.
If anyone should chance to come that
way, he wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to see the wounded
Sioux. The leaves would protect Angry Wolf
from the chill too, if Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t get
back before sundown.</p>
<p>Little Eagle followed the trail which the
Crows had made between their two camps. In
spite of the need to go swiftly, he held himself
to the pace he had been taught. Although it
seemed to be taking him a long time to make
the journey, he was encouraged by the thought
that there would be horses at the Sioux camp.
He and Clawing Bear could make the return
trip quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>As he trotted along the trail, Little Eagle
kept a constant watch ahead. It was unlikely
that the Crows had left scouts behind, but
there was danger that other enemies might be
near. There was always the possibility that a
band of Pawnees would be hunting on land
which belonged to the Sioux.</p>
<p>Going through the valley where the Crow
camp had been pitched, Little Eagle looked
about without slackening his pace. He saw
many signs that the Crows had left hurriedly.
They had left several pieces of camp gear behind.
Little Eagle noticed one fine cooking
pot which he would have liked to take, but he
passed it.</p>
<p>By the time he reached the hillside where
he had hidden to rest when he left the Sioux
camp, Little Eagle was growing alarmed. Thus
far he had seen no spirals of smoke or other
signs which ought to have been coming from
camp. He should have met Sioux scouts.
Surely the chiefs would have sent scouts out
to watch the Crows when they failed to return
to the powwow. Or, if yesterday&rsquo;s powwow
had ended in a quarrel, there would be Sioux
scouts out to make sure that the Crows didn&rsquo;t
try a surprise attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The nearer Little Eagle came to the camping
place, the greater grew his fears. For the
first time since he had seen the Crow warriors
come back to their own camp at daybreak, he
became afraid that they had managed to carry
out a successful raid.</p>
<p>As he trotted up the hill, Little Eagle
thought back to the actions of the Crows. He
was sure they had spent considerable time following
the trail he had made to lead them
away from Angry Wolf. None of the returning
Crow warriors had had new scalps at their
belts. They had acted much more like defeated
warriors than like ones who had carried
out a successful raid. Even though he thought
of all those things, Little Eagle dreaded the
moment when he would look down onto the
Sioux camp.</p>
<p>When he reached the top of the hill, Little
Eagle saw that the camp was gone. Not a tepee
was in sight. His fears gave way to a feeling of
triumph when he saw there were no signs of
fighting. The tribe had escaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>When he studied the camping place, he
found as many signs of hasty breaking of camp
as there had been at the Crow camping place.
Little Eagle easily found the trail which led
toward the north. The tribe was headed toward
the Sioux winter camping grounds.</p>
<p>Little Eagle raised his bow above his head
and gave a shout of triumph. Here was proof
that he and Angry Wolf had succeeded. In
some way, what they had done had warned
the Sioux that the Crows were planning
treachery and they had escaped. The feeling
of triumph faded quickly. How could he alone
save Angry Wolf&rsquo;s life?</p>
<p>Little Eagle walked slowly along the trail
left by the fleeing tribe. Someone should have
left a message for Angry Wolf and him. There
should be pointers to tell them where they
could join the party and other marks to show
how to signal for help, but he couldn&rsquo;t find
any. There were many signs to show that the
party had gone swiftly. Little Eagle knew there
was no hope he could overtake it on foot. He
tried to hide from himself his fears and disappointment
as he turned to go back to Angry
Wolf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>He had scarcely taken a dozen steps on the
return trip when he thought of Clawing Bear.
The other Sioux might be convinced that he
and Angry Wolf had fallen to the Crows, but
Clawing Bear would have hope that they
would escape. The medicine man wouldn&rsquo;t
leave without hiding a message for them.
Little Eagle turned back to the place where
Clawing Bear&rsquo;s tepee had stood.</p>
<p>He found the message at once. There were
only a few piles of stones and sticks, but Little
Eagle easily read the story they told.</p>
<p>When it had been learned that both Angry
Wolf and he had slipped through the line of
dog soldiers, there had been great anger in
camp. When they didn&rsquo;t return after nightfall,
the best dog soldier scouts had been sent to
find them. Some of these scouts had come
upon hidden Crows. They had looked down
on the first Crow camp and seen the preparations
for an attack. As soon as most of the
scouts reported back to camp, the chiefs had
ordered the tribe to move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the Crows were fleeing,&rdquo; Little
Eagle said aloud. &ldquo;Their scouts found our
camp abandoned. They were afraid this party
would circle to cut them off and at the same
time send for help. They were afraid they
would be caught in the same sort of trap they
set for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had read the message, Little Eagle
looked farther. He found the sign pointing to
the cache. Clawing Bear had hidden the sign
well. That meant that whatever was hidden
was so valuable Clawing Bear didn&rsquo;t want it to
fall into enemy hands.</p>
<p>Little Eagle had to do considerable searching
before he found the hiding place. Clawing
Bear had so cleverly put the dirt back into the
place that it was almost impossible to find.
Little Eagle dug the dirt loose with a pointed
stick and scooped it out with his hands. The
stick struck something solid. When Little
Eagle scooped away the dirt, he found a cooking
bowl turned upside down. As soon as he
lifted the bowl, he saw the leather bag. He was
trembling with excitement when he picked
up the bag. He unwrapped one of the small
packages it contained. It was a package of
powdered herbs used in making the poultice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t need to open the other
packages to know that they contained the
other necessary materials. Truly Clawing Bear
was a great medicine man. In some mysterious
way he had learned that Little Eagle would
need these things.</p>
<p>Little Eagle glanced up at the sky. The sun
was almost straight overhead. He had been
gone a long time. Now that he had the things
to cure Angry Wolf, it was important that he
get back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Little Eagle tied the leather bag to his belt.
He stooped down to pick up the cooking
bowl, but changed his mind. He would take
the larger one he had seen abandoned in the
Crow camp.</p>
<p>As he hurried back toward Angry Wolf, all
kinds of fears tormented Little Eagle. Without
water, Angry Wolf might not still be alive.
Some enemy might have passed that way and
found him. Little Eagle used all of his will
power to hold a reasonable pace. He reminded
himself that if he became exhausted, there
would be no one to care for Angry Wolf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>When he went through the valley where
the Crow camp had been, Little Eagle stopped
only long enough to pick up the cooking pot.
By the time he reached the hill on which he
had left Angry Wolf, he was so tired that he
had to drive himself to keep going. Yet, when
he knelt beside Angry Wolf and saw that the
wounded boy still breathed, he forgot his
weariness.</p>
<p>As soon as he had given Angry Wolf a drink
of water, Little Eagle started to build a fire.
He knew it would be dangerous. It would
lead any passing enemy to them. Still he must
cook the poultice to put on Angry Wolf&rsquo;s
wound. To make the danger as small as possible,
he selected dry, hard sticks for the fire.
These would give off little smoke and would
soon burn to a bed of glowing embers.</p>
<p>When he had the fire going, Little Eagle
poured some of the water into the bowl. He
set the bowl on the fire. While the water was
heating, Little Eagle took the packages from
the bag. He found a packet of bear&rsquo;s grease
and laid it close at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>As soon as the water was boiling, Little
Eagle used two sticks as tongs and picked the
bowl from the fire. He moved the sticks so as
to slosh the water around in the bowl. When
he had cleaned the bowl as much as possible,
he dumped the dirty water out. He rinsed the
bowl with the water that was left in the bag
before he set it back on the fire.</p>
<p>Little Eagle dropped some bear&rsquo;s grease
into the bowl. While he was waiting for it to
melt, he examined the poultice on Angry
Wolf&rsquo;s head. Although blood was seeping
around the edges, the poultice seemed to be
firmly in place. He would need water to soak
it so he could remove it.</p>
<p>Little Eagle took the two bags and started
toward the stream. He was so tired that the
journey seemed longer than the trip he had
made back to the Sioux camping place. It was
fortunate for him that there were no enemies
about. He couldn&rsquo;t arouse himself enough to
take care. Several times he stepped on twigs
which snapped loudly.</p>
<p>Back at the fire, Little Eagle picked up a
small stick. He poured portions of the powdered
herbs from each package into the bowl,
stirring all the time with the stick. He stirred
the mixture until it started to bubble. Then
he picked the bowl from the fire, using the
same sticks for tongs that he had used before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>While the mixture was cooling, Little
Eagle took one of the bags of water. He let
water drip from it onto the poultice on Angry
Wolf&rsquo;s wound. The water washed the blood
away from the edges of the wound, but it
didn&rsquo;t soften the poultice. Little Eagle
squatted beside Angry Wolf and carefully
thought back over the lessons Clawing Bear
had taught him. Clawing Bear&rsquo;s words finally
came back to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poultice will fall off when the wound
is cured,&rdquo; the medicine man had said. &ldquo;If the
wound starts to bleed again, put a new poultice
over the old one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle was almost cheerful as he went
back to the bowl. The mixture had cooled
enough so that he could dip it up in his hands.
He kneaded it with his fingers until it was soft
and pliable. He spread it over the old poultice,
making sure that the edges were tight
against the skin so that there was no blood
seeping from the wound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Clawing Bear,&rdquo; Little Eagle
said aloud, when he saw that the wound was
no longer bleeding.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until he had finished caring for
Angry Wolf that Little Eagle realized how
hungry he was. He had eaten nothing since he
and Angry Wolf had shared that small piece
of meat the evening before. The thought of
venison steak made his mouth water. He had
seen the place where deer came to the stream
to drink. However, he was afraid to leave
Angry Wolf long enough to stalk a deer. Tonight
some small game&mdash;a rabbit or a squirrel&mdash;would
have to do.</p>
<p>Little Eagle picked up his bow and arrow.
He remembered that the water sacks were
empty, so he tied them to his belt. He had
seen squirrels in some of the trees between
here and the creek. He kept watch of the trees
as he walked along. When he saw a pair of
squirrels running along the limb of a tree, he
stopped. Slowly he brought his bow up. The
moment one of the squirrels stopped, Little
Eagle let an arrow fly. He grinned to himself
as the squirrel dropped from the tree with an
arrow through its head. Perhaps the next time
he was in a shooting match he would win a
prize.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>At the creek Little Eagle filled the water
bags. He skinned and dressed the squirrel and
washed it in the stream.</p>
<p>When he returned to Angry Wolf, Little
Eagle put water into the cooking bowl and set
it on the fire. He cut the squirrel into small
pieces and dropped them into the bowl. As
the first tantalizing odors of cooking meat rose
from the bowl, he was tempted to take one of
the pieces and eat it before it was done. To
keep himself busy while the meat was cooking,
he found a small stick. He pulled the
bark from it and scraped off the loose fiber.</p>
<p>He waited until he was sure the meat was
thoroughly cooked before he lifted the bowl
from the fire. He set the steaming bowl close
to Angry Wolf. Little Eagle dipped the stick
into the bowl, then held it so the broth
dropped onto Angry Wolf&rsquo;s lips. Angry Wolf
opened his mouth and swallowed the drops
hungrily. Patiently, Little Eagle dipped the
stick into the broth and let the broth fall into
Angry Wolf&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>When he had given Angry Wolf all of the
broth he could dip out with the stick, Little
Eagle ate the meat. By the time he had finished,
the sun was down. Already the air was
becoming chilly. He considered building the
fire up so that Angry Wolf would be kept
warm. Because a fire could be seen a long distance
at night, he decided against that plan.
He covered the fire with dirt. In order to keep
Angry Wolf as warm as possible, Little Eagle
gathered more leaves and dumped them over
the wounded Sioux.</p>
<p>Little Eagle gathered a smaller pile of
leaves for himself. It was scarcely dark when
he snuggled down into the leaves. He fell
asleep while he was still trying to get into a
more comfortable position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c4">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<p>Little Eagle awoke as the first, faint streaks of
dawn were lighting up the eastern sky. He sat
up, trying to decide what sound had wakened
him. He glanced toward the other pile of
leaves and saw Angry Wolf struggling to sit
up. Angry Wolf managed to raise his head,
but immediately let it sink back upon the
leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; Angry Wolf asked weakly
when Little Eagle bent over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re camping by ourselves,&rdquo; Little Eagle
answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are&mdash;&rdquo; Angry Wolf began but
stopped when Little Eagle raised his finger to
his lips in the signal for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been badly wounded,&rdquo; Little
Eagle explained. &ldquo;When you have eaten, I&rsquo;ll
tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle held one of the water bags to
Angry Wolf&rsquo;s lips so that he could drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get meat for our breakfast,&rdquo; Little
Eagle told him.</p>
<p>Little Eagle saw that the chill morning air
was making Angry Wolf uncomfortable, but
he was afraid to build a fire until he had
scouted around their camping place. He tied
the one empty water bag to his belt, took his
bow and arrows, and started off.</p>
<p>Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t go directly to the stream.
Instead, he circled the camp to look for signs
of enemies. Not until he had completed the
circle did he start toward the creek. On the
way, he stopped often to look and listen. By
the time he reached the stream, he was sure
that there were no enemies near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>He studied the place where deer came
down to drink. There were signs that deer had
been there a short time before. It wasn&rsquo;t likely
that others would use the same watering place
soon, so Little Eagle shot another squirrel.
He cleaned and dressed it at the stream.</p>
<p>As soon as he was back at camp, Little
Eagle built another fire. He spitted the squirrel
on a stick and roasted it over the coals.
When the squirrel was cooked, Little Eagle
carried it to Angry Wolf. Angry Wolf took it,
but he didn&rsquo;t have strength enough to tear it
apart. He handed it back to Little Eagle.
Little Eagle twisted off a chunk which he
handed to his friend. Angry Wolf accepted
the piece of meat, but he didn&rsquo;t start to eat.
Little Eagle looked at him questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I eat when you eat,&rdquo; Angry Wolf told
him.</p>
<p>Little Eagle took a piece of the meat for
himself. Both of them ate until the meat was
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me how I came here,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf ordered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>As briefly as possible, Little Eagle told him
all that had happened since Angry Wolf had
been knocked from the horse. As he finished
his account, Little Eagle looked toward Angry
Wolf. The other boy&rsquo;s eyes were closed and
he seemed to be asleep. Little Eagle picked
up his bow and arrow and got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Angry Wolf asked,
opening his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need more meat,&rdquo; Little Eagle explained.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to get a deer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it go until tomorrow,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
answered. &ldquo;You have done everything. You
need a rest. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be strong enough
to do my share. Let the hunting go until
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle tried to hide the doubt he felt
when he looked toward his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in much-fought-over land,&rdquo; he
pointed out. &ldquo;Tomorrow some of our enemies
may come here. Then we would have no
chance to hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Angry Wolf agreed slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a bag of water where you can
reach it,&rdquo; Little Eagle told him. &ldquo;There is
much game. I shouldn&rsquo;t be gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prop me up and put my bow near me before
you leave,&rdquo; Angry Wolf suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Little Eagle found a large limb which had
been blown from one of the trees during a
storm. He dragged this over and put it behind
Angry Wolf. He put a water bag as well
as the bow and arrows where Angry Wolf
could reach them easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some good hunting arrows,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf said. &ldquo;Take two of them. Any hunter
might miss one shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle selected two arrows from
Angry Wolf&rsquo;s quiver. Before leaving, he
made another scouting trip around their
camp. When he had made sure that there
were no enemies near, he started off.</p>
<p>Little Eagle went to the creek. He studied
the place where deer came to drink. There
were many tracks on the other side of the
creek. He wet his finger and held it up to tell
from which direction the wind was blowing.
He gave a pleased nod when he found it was
blowing from the other side of the creek toward
him. He jumped across the creek and
went straight into the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Little Eagle picked his way with care. He
went slowly, being careful to make no sound
that would warn game ahead of him. He
hadn&rsquo;t gone far when he sighted five deer
grazing in a small meadow.</p>
<p>The meadow was completely surrounded
by trees. Although the deer were grazing near
the middle of it, they were within bowshot of
the nearest trees. Little Eagle dampened his
finger again and tested the slight breeze. It
was blowing directly from the deer toward
him.</p>
<p>As he worked his way toward the deer,
Little Eagle noticed that the stag constantly
lifted his head and sniffed as though sensing
danger. Little Eagle was sure that he was
moving so quietly the deer couldn&rsquo;t hear him.
With the wind blowing from the deer toward
the boy, the stag couldn&rsquo;t catch his scent. Still
the animal continued to sniff and move about
uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Little Eagle stopped. In some way his
movements must be carrying a warning to
the deer. However, while Little Eagle remained
motionless, the stag continued to
sniff. Suddenly he snorted and bounded high
into the air. While Little Eagle watched helplessly,
the whole herd raced away. In a moment
he saw the cause of the deer&rsquo;s alarm.
Two big gray wolves dashed out of their
hiding place toward the nearest doe. Both
wolves sprang, but both missed, and the deer
were gone.</p>
<p>Little Eagle was so angry that he brought
the bow up and took aim at one of the wolves.
Before he let the arrow fly, he remembered
that it was one of Angry Wolf&rsquo;s good hunting
arrows. If he missed the wolf, or merely
wounded it, the arrow would be lost. Reluctantly
he lowered the bow.</p>
<p>There would be no chance to stalk those
fleeing deer. Little Eagle knew the stag might
lead his herd for miles before he allowed them
to stop and graze again. When he saw the
wolves slink off to the right, Little Eagle
turned to his left.</p>
<p>He continued until the sun was straight
overhead without finding another herd of
deer. Disappointedly, he turned back toward
the creek. This was too far for him to carry
a deer if he managed to get one. Besides, he
didn&rsquo;t like to stay away from Angry Wolf so
long. Angry Wolf was better, but he was still
far from well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Twice on the journey back to the creek,
Little Eagle saw small herds of deer. Each time
the wind was blowing from him toward them.
They caught his scent and dashed away long
before he was within bowshot of them.</p>
<p>Little Eagle reached the creek at a place
far downstream from where he had crossed
before. He turned to follow the bank to the
place where he had crossed. He had covered
about half of the distance when he saw a stag
and two does grazing near the creek. The
deer were in a small, grassy glade. They were
so far from the trees that it didn&rsquo;t seem possible
for Little Eagle to get close enough to
them. Still he didn&rsquo;t want to give up without
trying.</p>
<p>He tested the wind again. Before he started
toward the deer, Little Eagle worked his way
to a point where the wind was blowing from
them to him. From the cover of the trees nearest
the deer, Little Eagle measured the distance
with his eye. It was too far for a bowshot.
He would have to try to reach the clump of
shrubs between him and the deer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The deer continued to graze while Little
Eagle crawled toward them. He reached the
clump of shrubs without alarming the game.
He was still a long bowshot from the deer,
but as there was no more cover between him
and them, he had to risk a shot from where
he was.</p>
<p>As Little Eagle slowly raised his bow, the
stag lifted his head and sniffed suspiciously.
Little Eagle took careful aim at the nearest
doe. He pulled the bowstring back with all
of his strength. At the instant Little Eagle
released the arrow, the stag snorted and gave
a tremendous leap. Before the doe could heed
the warning, the arrow struck her. The doe
crumpled to the ground. Little Eagle gave a
low cry of triumph. Here was food to last
several days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Dressing the deer was slow work. It had
looked easy when Little Eagle had watched a
warrior do it. He found it wasn&rsquo;t nearly so
easy as it had looked. He could have skinned
the deer more quickly if he hadn&rsquo;t been so
careful not to cut a hole in the hide. This
was the first deer he had ever shot. He had
been told that if a hunter removed the hide
from the first deer or buffalo he shot without
cutting a hole in it, he would always be a
successful hunter.</p>
<p>When he finally had the hide removed,
Little Eagle looked it over carefully. He had
done it. There wasn&rsquo;t a single hole. He finished
dressing the carcass and tied it as high
in a tree as he could reach. When that was
done, he carried the hide to the stream where
he buried it in the soft mud. He went back to
the carcass and cut off a large chunk of meat
to take with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Little Eagle approached camp uneasily. He
had been gone much longer than he had
planned. In that time many things could have
happened to Angry Wolf. As he stepped into
sight of the camp, Little Eagle stopped abruptly.
Angry Wolf had picked up his bow
and was holding it with an arrow pointing
straight at Little Eagle. In his surprise, Little
Eagle didn&rsquo;t notice that Angry Wolf hadn&rsquo;t
the strength to draw the bowstring back. When
Angry Wolf saw that it was Little Eagle approaching
the camp, he lowered the bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are better,&rdquo; Little Eagle exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be able to travel,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf assured him.</p>
<p>As soon as he had a fire started, Little Eagle
cut steaks from the piece of meat he had
brought to camp. He noticed that both water
bags were empty, so he took them to the creek
and filled them while the meat was cooking.</p>
<p>While they were eating, Angry Wolf insisted
that Little Eagle again tell all that had
taken place since he had been wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe my life to you,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said,
when Little Eagle finished the account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have done the same for me,&rdquo;
Little Eagle insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have known how,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
admitted. &ldquo;When we were trying to get horses
from the Crows, I thought I should do it because
I am older than you. Now you have
proved that you are the real leader.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are many things I should have
learned from our teacher,&rdquo; Little Eagle protested.
&ldquo;In winter camp I will learn more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time both boys were quiet. When
Angry Wolf broke the silence, he spoke
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a long journey on foot to the winter
camp,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Old-man-of-the-north might
send snow to catch us on the prairie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle shuddered. He knew what it
would be like to be caught on the prairie in
a blizzard. They had no tepee to shelter them,
nor blankets to keep them warm. There were
places where they might travel on foot for
several suns without seeing a tree. If they
were caught in one of those places, they would
be without fuel or shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get horses,&rdquo; Little Eagle urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is late in the season for hunting parties
to be here,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said. &ldquo;There may
be no one from whom we can take horses.
Besides, our medicine is not strong. We didn&rsquo;t
get any horses from the Crows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; Little Eagle demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow we can decide,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf suggested. &ldquo;It may be that while we
sleep, you will have a dream to guide us. You
have studied under Clawing Bear. You might
have a medicine dream like a medicine man
or a warrior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I do,&rdquo; Little Eagle responded.</p>
<p>Little Eagle took the log away from Angry
Wolf&rsquo;s back. As soon as Angry Wolf had
stretched out on the pile of leaves, Little Eagle
put armloads of leaves over him. Before he
crawled into his own pile of leaves, Little
Eagle covered the fire with dirt.</p>
<p>When he awoke in the morning, Little
Eagle could taste disappointment like bitter
food. He had hoped that a dream to guide
them would come to him in his sleep, but
there had been none. He glanced toward
Angry Wolf. The look on Angry Wolf&rsquo;s face
told plainly that he had had no vision either.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Angry Wolf got slowly to his feet. He stood
for a moment, weaving from side to side.
Little Eagle jumped up and ran to him when
it looked as though Angry Wolf would fall.
He steadied Angry Wolf while the wounded
boy sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still weak,&rdquo; Angry Wolf admitted unhappily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are stronger than you have been,&rdquo;
Little Eagle encouraged him. &ldquo;That is the
first time you have been able to get to your
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had eaten, Angry Wolf again stood
up. He was able to take only a few steps before
he had to sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be another day before I can travel,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Little Eagle picked up the water bags. One
was empty and the other had only a little in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink this,&rdquo; he said, offering the water
bag to Angry Wolf. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fill both of them and
bring more meat back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should get closer to the stream,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf told him. &ldquo;This is too far for you to
carry water and food. Besides, you are making
a trail which can easily be seen if an enemy
comes this way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Little Eagle had thought of the danger of
an enemy stumbling onto his trail. Wherever
they camped, there would be danger of someone
finding them. Here was the added danger
that the trail leading to their camp would be
found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to carry you,&rdquo; he offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lean on you and walk,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
replied.</p>
<p>Little Eagle kicked dirt over the fire. He
brushed about the camping place with a small
branch. It wasn&rsquo;t possible to hide the signs
that they had been there, but by brushing
over the ground, Little Eagle made it difficult
for anyone to judge how long they had been
gone.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf had difficulty walking. The
first two or three steps he was able to go by
placing his hand lightly on Little Eagle&rsquo;s
shoulder. He rapidly grew weaker and had
to lean heavily on Little Eagle. They went
slowly, stopping often to rest. The day was
half gone by the time they reached the stream.
Angry Wolf was so exhausted that he sprawled
on the ground and immediately fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The next few days were busy ones for Little
Eagle. Twice a day he made a scouting trip
around their camp. He built a lean-to which
would protect them in case of a storm. He
brought the rest of the meat into camp and
tied it in a nearby tree. Whenever he could
find time, he added to the supply of firewood.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf gained strength slowly. The
first two days after his long walk to camp, he
spent most of the time sleeping. The third
day he managed to walk to the creek for water.
That evening the poultice fell from his wound.
When Little Eagle looked at the wound, he
found that it was completely closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another day or two I&rsquo;ll be able to
travel,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will,&rdquo; Little Eagle agreed.</p>
<p>The fourth morning Little Eagle started
the day by making his usual scouting trip. He
crossed the stream and went south to the first
row of hills. As he was going up the hill, he
stopped and sniffed the air. The wind was
blowing from the other side of the hill toward
him. It carried a faint odor of wood smoke.
He used all the skill he had to reach the top
of the hill without giving warning to whoever
was on the other side of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>His first glance from the top of the hill
showed him that there was no one camping in
the valley below. There were only two trees
in the valley. The branches on them were so
high that Little Eagle would have been able
to see any camp under them. But the smell
of smoke was stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp must be across the hill on the
other side of this valley,&rdquo; Little Eagle told
himself.</p>
<p>Little Eagle looked doubtfully at the valley
below him. If he crossed it to climb the hill
on the other side, he would have to walk in
the open. He shook his head. Since enemies
were so near, he would have to be very careful.
The best plan would be to circle to the
left where he could stay in the protection of
trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>It took him a long time to circle through the
trees to a place where he could look down
into the valley. When he saw the camp, he
knew it belonged to Pawnees. Most of the
tepees were hidden from him by trees, so he
couldn&rsquo;t count them and learn how many
warriors were in the party. The cooking fire
was in the open where he could see it. Several
warriors were gathered around it. Little Eagle
saw two of the men leave the campfire and go
toward the grove of trees west of camp. When
he looked in that direction, he saw horses
grazing. There were at least twenty horses in
sight, and others were hidden from him by
the grove.</p>
<p>Little Eagle watched the two warriors. He
saw them start to drive the horses toward
camp. If the horses were being brought in, it
must mean that the warriors were ready to
leave. Yet, when Little Eagle glanced back
toward the fire, the men were still sitting there.
It seemed that they were waiting for something
or someone. A couple of men got up
to go help the two with the horses, but no one
seemed to be in a hurry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>While Little Eagle was wondering if he
should try to get closer to the camp, a rider
came dashing toward it from the east. The
man jumped off his horse and spoke excitedly
to the others. The warriors suddenly sprang
into action. In a few moments every warrior
had caught a horse and was mounted. At a
signal from the man who had ridden into
camp, all of the warriors dashed off in the
direction from which the rider had come.</p>
<p>Little Eagle understood their actions as well
as if he had heard them talking. The rider
who had dashed into camp was a buffalo scout.
He had found a large herd of buffaloes near
camp and was leading the warriors to the hunt.
If the buffaloes had been far from camp, some
warrior would have been given the job of
bringing the herd of pack horses. The pack
horses would be needed to bring the meat into
camp.</p>
<p>Little Eagle looked longingly at the herd
of horses. If Angry Wolf and he had two of
them, they could safely risk the long journey
across the prairie. Little Eagle was confident
he could get two horses, since no warrior had
been left to guard the herd. By the time the
Pawnees had finished killing and butchering
buffaloes, he and Angry Wolf could have half
a sun&rsquo;s start. But Angry Wolf wasn&rsquo;t strong
enough to do the hard riding they must do
to escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Little Eagle turned away and hurried back
to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you learn?&rdquo; Angry Wolf asked
as Little Eagle came into sight.</p>
<p>For a moment Little Eagle looked at his
friend in surprise. Did Angry Wolf have the
power to look into his mind as Clawing Bear
had done? Little Eagle smiled at his own
foolishness. He had been gone longer than
usual. He had hurried back into camp. These
things had told Angry Wolf that he had discovered
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a party of Pawnee hunters,&rdquo;
Little Eagle answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they coming this way?&rdquo; Angry Wolf
asked quietly.</p>
<p>Little Eagle shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found a herd of buffaloes near their
camp,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re hunting now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad that you couldn&rsquo;t have taken
two of their horses,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;We would have had a chance to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could have taken two,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered.
&ldquo;The horses that the warriors weren&rsquo;t
riding were left unguarded in camp. I didn&rsquo;t
take them because I was afraid you weren&rsquo;t
strong enough to ride as hard as we would
need to ride in order to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could ride,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said. &ldquo;However,
it would be too dangerous for you to try to
get the horses. It is likely that someone would
catch you at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could still get them before the warriors
returned from hunting,&rdquo; Little Eagle insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be our last chance to get horses,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to get horses for us,&rdquo; Little
Eagle said, suddenly making up his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too dangerous,&rdquo; Angry Wolf repeated.
&ldquo;There is some danger you have overlooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Pawnees have finished dressing
the buffaloes they have killed, they will cure
the meat before leaving their camp,&rdquo; Little
Eagle pointed out. &ldquo;While the meat is curing,
the Pawnees will have time to scout. They
are sure to find our camp. There is a danger
that I have seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry Wolf smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are learning to be a good leader,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;If you think you can get horses for us,
I am willing that you try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle whirled around to leave camp.
Before he had gone a dozen steps, he turned
back to Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you take the horses?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;You have had more lessons from our teacher
than I have had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I would make a scouting trip to be
sure that the Pawnees will be hunting long
enough for us to get a safe start before they
discover the loss of their horses,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
answered thoughtfully. &ldquo;When I had the
horses, I&rsquo;d ride straight here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A confident smile touched the corners of
Little Eagle&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will get the horses,&rdquo; he vowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From here we&rsquo;ll leave a crooked trail,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf said with equal confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c5">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
<p>Instead of taking a direct route back to the
Pawnee camp, Little Eagle made a circle. This
took him to the valley where he was sure the
Pawnees were hunting. Before he reached
the top of the hill which formed the boundary
of the valley, Little Eagle could feel the ground
trembling. The Pawnees must have found a
tremendous herd of buffaloes.</p>
<p>From the top of the hill he could see the
progress of the hunt. The far end of the valley
was covered by the fleeing herd. Some of the
buffaloes had crossed the hill and were out of
sight. Already the valley was dotted with the
carcasses of slain buffaloes. The Pawnees were
still riding into the herd, selecting young cows
to be slain and added to the supply of meat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Little Eagle knew how Sioux hunters would
do if they were on this hunt. They would kill
as many buffaloes as they could use. As soon
as they had enough, each hunter would start
dressing those he had killed. As Little Eagle
watched, a Pawnee hunter stopped his horse,
dismounted, and started skinning one of the
buffaloes he had killed. Another warrior, and
another, turned back to the slain buffaloes
until the whole party of hunters was busy
skinning and dressing buffaloes.</p>
<p>Little Eagle waited only long enough to
make sure that no warrior was sent to bring
the horses, before he turned toward the Pawnee
camp. Little Eagle kept a sharp watch as
he approached the horses. He could have made
a mistake when he watched the hunters leave
the camp. A warrior might have been left to
watch the horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>As soon as he was sure there was no one
watching the herd, Little Eagle went straight
to the horses. A few of them moved away from
him, but most of them continued grazing. He
selected the two that he thought were the best
in the herd. He jumped onto the back of one
of them and took the halter rope of the other.</p>
<p>Little Eagle made no attempt to hide his
trail. Angry Wolf had said they would make a
crooked trail when they left camp. There had
been many lessons about how to hide a trail.
Angry Wolf probably knew most of the tricks.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle rode into camp, Angry
Wolf was ready to leave. He had made a bundle
of the small piece of meat left from the
deer Little Eagle had shot. He had dug up
the deer hide and washed it in the stream.
Little Eagle noticed that Angry Wolf had
brushed around the camping place with a tree
branch and had even scooped up the coals
from the fire and dumped them into the
stream. When the Pawnees trailed the horses
to this camp, they would learn little about
how many had camped there or how long they
had been gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Little Eagle took the package of meat and
the deer hide. He watched anxiously as Angry
Wolf climbed onto the back of the other horse.
Ordinarily, Little Eagle would have tossed the
halter rope to Angry Wolf before he started
to mount. This time he held it until Angry
Wolf was safely on his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow the trail the Crows made,&rdquo;
Little Eagle called to his companion as they
started off.</p>
<p>Little Eagle took the path he had made
when he had been carrying water to Angry
Wolf. He had planned to turn toward the
place where the Crow chiefs had camped. Before
he reached the trail, he changed his mind.
It might be easier to fool the Pawnees if they
were led to believe their enemies were Crows.</p>
<p>Although his horse was eager to run, Little
Eagle held it to a walk. He continually looked
back over his shoulder to see how Angry Wolf
was getting along. He was pleased to see that
Angry Wolf was sitting erectly on his horse.
He didn&rsquo;t appear to be any more tired than
he would have been in camp. At a place where
the trail went over level ground, Angry Wolf
brought his horse alongside that of Little
Eagle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Pawnees have many buffaloes?&rdquo;
Angry Wolf asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to feed a big camp many days,&rdquo;
Little Eagle replied. &ldquo;The sun will be far
down by the time they have all of them
skinned and butchered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have a long start before they notice their loss.
However, as soon as the Pawnees learn they
have lost horses, they&rsquo;ll send two or three
trackers on our trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle shifted uneasily on his horse.
There were many good trackers among the
Sioux, but none so good as the Pawnees. Many
times he had heard warriors tell about Pawnees
following trails that it had seemed impossible
for anyone to find.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>As the sun began to slip down the western
sky, Little Eagle lost some of his uneasiness.
Angry Wolf was still riding erectly. Perhaps,
if they had to increase their speed, Angry Wolf
could stand the pace. At the top of each hill,
both Angry Wolf and Little Eagle looked back
down the trail. Each time they were relieved
that there was no sign of pursuit. Before the
sun went down, they stopped at the top of a
high hill. Little Eagle jumped from his horse
and climbed a tall tree. From there he could
see a long way back. There was no sign of
Pawnees.</p>
<p>The Crow trail turned into land that was
much rougher. There were chains of steep
hills with only narrow valleys between them.
Every valley had a stream flowing through it.
At each stream, Little Eagle considered riding
up the stream where they would leave no
tracks. Each time he decided that the farther
he and Angry Wolf rode along the Crow trail,
the more likely the Pawnees would be to turn
back.</p>
<p>There was still daylight left when Little
Eagle noticed that Angry Wolf was slumped
over his horse&rsquo;s neck. Evidently Angry Wolf
had suddenly become so tired that he could
scarcely stay on his horse. Once Little Eagle
saw him grasp his horse&rsquo;s mane to save himself
from falling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make camp,&rdquo; Little Eagle
called to his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have escaped,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
agreed. &ldquo;Anyway I need rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were near the top of another of those
high hills. When they reached the top, Little
Eagle jumped from his horse and handed the
halter rope to Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch the trail for a while,&rdquo; Little
Eagle said. &ldquo;You ride to the stream at the foot
of the hill. We&rsquo;ll camp there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Angry Wolf rode ahead, Little Eagle
found a place from which he could see back
along the trail they had followed. In the dusk
he couldn&rsquo;t see far. Nevertheless, he felt he
should watch for a while.</p>
<p>Little Eagle heard the Pawnees before he
could see them. He could tell by the pound of
hoofbeats that the Pawnees were riding hard.
Evidently they weren&rsquo;t afraid of riding into an
ambush. Perhaps those expert trackers had
found signs that told them they were following
two boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Little Eagle had his first glimpse of the
Pawnees when they stopped at the stream.
He was relieved to see there were only two.
One of the Pawnees dismounted and stepped
across the stream. Since Little Eagle and Angry
Wolf had made no effort to hide their trail,
the Pawnee found it at once. The warrior
signaled for the other Pawnee to bring the
horses.</p>
<p>Little Eagle knew it was too late for him
to run to Angry Wolf with a warning. The
Pawnees would be upon them before they
could mount. He had to stop the Pawnees.
He saw a hiding place farther down the hill.
While the Pawnee warrior was remounting,
Little Eagle slipped to the hiding place he had
selected.</p>
<p>By the time he had hidden himself, Little
Eagle had decided how far he would let the
Pawnees ride up the trail. He tried to control
the shaking of his hands as he raised the bow.
He aimed an arrow at the nearer Pawnee and
slowly moved the bow to keep the arrow
pointed at him as the warrior approached.
This was a far more important shot than the
one he had taken at the deer. If he had missed
the deer, there would have been other chances
later. If he missed the Pawnee, neither he nor
Angry Wolf would escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>The Pawnee was almost to the spot Little
Eagle had decided upon as the limit. Little
Eagle held his breath to steady his hands. He
pulled the bowstring back. At the instant
Little Eagle let the arrow fly, the warrior&rsquo;s
horse half stumbled. The arrow hit the Pawnee
higher than Little Eagle had aimed, but
it hit true enough to knock the Pawnee from
his horse.</p>
<p>The other Pawnee acted so quickly that
Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t have a chance for another
shot. The warrior wheeled his horse from the
trail into the shelter of some tall bushes. Little
Eagle leaned forward, trying to keep the Pawnee
in sight. He was sure the warrior would
get off his horse and try to sneak around him
or would send his horse charging toward the
spot from which the arrow had come. To
Little Eagle&rsquo;s amazement, the warrior rode out
onto the trail beside his wounded companion.
He jumped from his horse, picked the
wounded man up, and placed him on his
own horse. The wounded warrior&rsquo;s horse was
already trotting back down the trail. The
Pawnee leaped on his horse behind his
wounded companion and rode back the way
he had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Little Eagle brought his bow up and took
careful aim at the warrior&rsquo;s back, but he didn&rsquo;t
let the arrow fly. He hadn&rsquo;t supposed that
anyone, unless perhaps a Sioux warrior, would
have the courage to do what that Pawnee had
done. While he despised himself for his weakness,
he couldn&rsquo;t shoot that brave warrior in
the back. He gave a little sigh of relief when
the warrior was out of sight and the chance
to shoot him was gone.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle reached Angry Wolf, he
found the other boy stretched out on the
ground. Angry Wolf raised himself on one
elbow as Little Eagle approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You were
gone a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle gave an account of what had
occurred. He hesitated when he told about
letting the second Pawnee escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was so brave I couldn&rsquo;t shoot him in
the back,&rdquo; Little Eagle said in a shamed voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I would have let him go too,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
admitted. &ldquo;Not many warriors are that brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the whole party of Pawnees
will come after us now?&rdquo; Little Eagle asked.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf was silent for a while. Little
Eagle knew the other boy was thinking of the
stories their teacher had told them around the
campfire. Many of those stories had been about
other tribes and the ways they fought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they will,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said after
a long pause. &ldquo;The Pawnees will want to get
revenge for the loss of their horses and especially
for the wounded man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle opened the package of meat.
There were a couple of small pieces that had
been cooked. He and Angry Wolf made a
meal on those pieces. When they had finished
eating, Angry Wolf stretched out on the
ground to rest. Little Eagle started to get to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie down and rest,&rdquo; Angry Wolf ordered.
&ldquo;We will have to go on, but we should rest
first. We will have time before the other Pawnees
start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Although he wasn&rsquo;t at all sure that the Pawnees
wouldn&rsquo;t be upon them at any moment,
Little Eagle obeyed. He stretched out beside
Angry Wolf and fell asleep. It seemed to him
that he had scarcely closed his eyes when
Angry Wolf touched him gently on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should ride on,&rdquo; the older boy
said. &ldquo;We ought to follow this trail a short
distance and then turn up one of the streams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle caught the horses and brought
them to where Angry Wolf was waiting. Slowly
and painfully, Angry Wolf got to his feet.
Little Eagle had to help him onto his horse.</p>
<p>Little Eagle led the way along the trail until
they came to the third stream. Here he turned
upstream. Both horses fought against the halter
ropes, trying to get out of the cold water.
When the animals found they wouldn&rsquo;t be
allowed to get out of the water, they went
more rapidly. There were places where the
horses sloshed through pools. At every step,
water was splashed high into the air. Both
Little Eagle and Angry Wolf were thoroughly
soaked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/i4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="709" />
<p class="caption"><i>At every step water splashed high</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>When he glanced back over his shoulder,
Little Eagle saw Angry Wolf bent low on his
horse&rsquo;s neck. Little Eagle pulled his horse to
a stop and motioned for Angry Wolf to take
the lead. If Angry Wolf fell from his horse,
Little Eagle wanted to be ready to save his
friend.</p>
<p>The stream wound through steep, wooded
hills. What little light the stars gave was almost
entirely shut off by the trees. Little Eagle
could see very little on either side of the
stream. After they had ridden a long time,
Little Eagle noticed a change. The hills were
farther back from the stream and there were
fewer trees on them. The farther he and Angry
Wolf went, the fewer were the trees.</p>
<p>It seemed to Little Eagle that they must
have been riding most of the night when he
saw a tiny creek flowing into the stream they
were following. He called softly for Angry
Wolf to turn off into the creek. Angry Wolf
obeyed without answering. They followed the
creek until it ended abruptly in a gushing
spring at the foot of a hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Angry Wolf waited and let Little Eagle lead
the way. Little Eagle rode along the base of
the hill until he came to a place where a narrow
finger of a valley extended back into the
hills. Here both riders dismounted. They
turned the horses loose to graze. Little Eagle
unfolded the deerskin and put the fur side
down. Both he and Angry Wolf crawled under
it and fell asleep at once.</p>
<p>Little Eagle awoke at daybreak. When he
crawled out from under the deerskin, he saw
that the grass was covered with a heavy layer
of frost. He watched anxiously as Angry Wolf
got to his feet. He noticed that in spite of
yesterday&rsquo;s hard travel, Angry Wolf seemed
much stronger. He walked easily and held
himself erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are almost well,&rdquo; Little Eagle told
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am strong enough to start our trip to
the winter camp,&rdquo; Angry Wolf agreed. &ldquo;It is
time we were starting,&rdquo; he added, kicking at
the heavy frost on the grass. &ldquo;Old-man-of-the-north
will soon send snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow will hide our trail from our enemies,&rdquo;
Little Eagle said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will make traveling harder for us, too,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf replied.</p>
<p>The two boys went to explore the finger of
the valley. They found it was a narrow, grassy
glen with a few trees in the middle. It was
ringed with steep hills. The only entrance was
the one through which they had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it will be safe to start a fire
and cook meat?&rdquo; Angry Wolf asked.</p>
<p>Little Eagle noticed how differently Angry
Wolf treated him from the way he had when
they were planning to get horses from the
Crows. Then, because he was older, Angry
Wolf had wanted to make all the plans without
asking Little Eagle&rsquo;s advice. Now, he
seemed to think that Little Eagle was the wiser
and should decide what was to be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is dangerous, but we need food,&rdquo; Little
Eagle answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Little Eagle went back to the entrance
where they had left the meat. By the time he
returned, Angry Wolf had a small fire started.
While Angry Wolf tended the fire, adding
fuel slowly so there would be little smoke,
Little Eagle cut the meat into slices. They
cooked all of the meat and ate as much as they
wanted. Little Eagle made a package of what
was left. He covered the fire with dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to catch the horses so we
can start on?&rdquo; Angry Wolf asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be better if we stay here today,&rdquo;
Little Eagle answered. &ldquo;The Pawnees will
come to look for us. I don&rsquo;t think they will
find the old trail we made. If we make a new
one, they might find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought of that,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf said.</p>
<p>Little Eagle went back to the place where
the glen opened into the main valley. He
could see across the valley and to the tops of
the hills on the other side. No one could go
through the valley without being in sight.</p>
<p>Little Eagle heard the faint stir of footsteps
in the grass behind him. As suddenly as a
startled deer, he twisted aside and rolled over.
At the same time he brought his bow up. He
had an arrow pointed straight at Angry Wolf.
He felt foolish as he lowered the bow. There
had been a frightened look on Angry Wolf&rsquo;s
face. It gave way to a smile of admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are becoming a warrior,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
said. &ldquo;It will not be easy for an enemy to take
you by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the Pawnees are coming,&rdquo;
Little Eagle said, thinking of the long journey
to the winter camp and the need to get started
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Angry Wolf replied. &ldquo;However,
I think your first plan a good one. Besides,
we need more rest. You go farther back
and sleep. If I need you, I&rsquo;ll toss a stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle took a couple of minutes to
decide which would be the better plan. The
heavy frost on the grass this morning was a
warning that winter could not be far off. He
and Angry Wolf had a long journey to make
across the prairie before they reached winter
camp. Perhaps they were being too cautious.
It was the need for rest rather than the fear
that the Pawnees would still come which decided
him. He went back to where they had
left the deerskin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Although he was sure his thoughts would
keep him awake, Little Eagle stretched out
on the deerskin. He closed his eyes against
the glare of the sun and fell asleep at once.
He was awakened by the rattle of a small
stone, falling in the grass near him.</p>
<p>Little Eagle crawled to a place beside Angry
Wolf. He saw the two Pawnee scouts at once.
They were riding up the trail on the other
side of the creek. Little Eagle watched the
scouts with a puzzled frown. The scouts didn&rsquo;t
seem to be watching for the place where their
enemies had ridden out of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t act as though they&rsquo;re looking
for our trail,&rdquo; Little Eagle whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect they know of a beaver dam farther
up the stream,&rdquo; Angry Wolf whispered back.</p>
<p>Little Eagle nodded. That was a likely explanation.
If the beavers had made a dam
across the stream farther up it, anyone riding
upstream would have to go around it. The
Pawnees must know of such a dam. They
would ride there, expecting to pick up the
trail again. It was lucky that he and Angry
Wolf had turned off here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The two Sioux watched the Pawnees until
a bend in the valley hid them from view.
Angry Wolf started to crawl away, but Little
Eagle touched his arm to stop him. It wasn&rsquo;t
long until a party of Pawnee warriors rode
into sight. Angry Wolf turned an admiring
glance on Little Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know a party of warriors
would follow those two Pawnee scouts?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me that was the way Pawnees
followed a trail,&rdquo; Little Eagle reminded him.
&ldquo;It is because you are so tired that you didn&rsquo;t
think of it,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Go back and sleep
while I watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry Wolf obeyed without protesting.
Little Eagle kept his eyes on the bend in the
valley where the Pawnees had disappeared.
Little Eagle smiled to himself as he thought
how surprised the Pawnee scouts would be
when they reached the beaver dam and
couldn&rsquo;t find their enemies&rsquo; trail. He and
Angry Wolf had certainly made a crooked
trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The warm sun had wiped away the frost and
dried the grass. For a while its heat made Little
Eagle drowsy. Now some clouds rolled up and
hid the sun. The wind was rising and it had a
chilly edge. Little Eagle raised his eyes to study
the clouds. He saw that it wouldn&rsquo;t be long
before rain started to fall.</p>
<p>His attention was drawn back to the trail
by the faint drumming sound made by the
hoofs of fast-running horses. The sound rapidly
became plainer. Little Eagle picked up a
small stone and tossed it back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>By the time Angry Wolf had crawled to
Little Eagle&rsquo;s side, the Pawnees were flying
back down the trail. Three riderless horses
raced ahead of the warriors. Little Eagle saw
that the Pawnees were whipping their horses,
trying to get them to go still faster. When he
saw the big band of Crows come into sight
around the bend, he understood why the Pawnees
were fleeing.</p>
<p>There must have been fifty warriors in that
band of pursuing Crows. The Crows were lashing
their ponies as furiously as were the Pawnees.
Three or four Crows were outdistancing
the rest of the pursuers and drawing closer to
the Pawnees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Most of the Pawnees leaned low over their
horses&rsquo; necks. One, at the rear of the group,
suddenly straightened up. He half turned and,
seemingly without taking aim, let an arrow fly.
The leading Crow dropped from his horse as
though he had been jerked off by an invisible,
giant hand.</p>
<p>The other Crows pulled their horses to a
stop around the fallen man. They hesitated
for only a moment before they raced on, but it
was long enough to allow the Pawnees to gain
a considerable distance.</p>
<p>Little Eagle and Angry Wolf watched the
chase until both parties were out of sight. They
continued to watch the fallen Crow where his
companions had left him, with his horse grazing
a few paces away. The sun was almost
down when the party of Crows returned. They
weren&rsquo;t leading any riderless ponies so it was
plain that the Pawnees had escaped. The
Crows stopped and picked up the slain warrior.
They laid him across the back of his own
horse and slowly rode out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a lesson we must remember,&rdquo; Little
Eagle said. &ldquo;The Pawnees were so anxious to
catch us that they forgot to watch for other
dangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they did kill a Crow,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were three Pawnee horses without
riders,&rdquo; Little Eagle reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a high price to pay for one enemy,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf agreed.</p>
<p>Both boys were silent for a while. Little
Eagle&rsquo;s thoughts were following the band of
Crows. It could have been the same band
which had planned to attack their camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crows have powerful medicine.&rdquo;
Angry Wolf spoke almost as if his thoughts
were following those of Little Eagle. &ldquo;It is fortunate
that we were able to get horses from the
Pawnees. If we had tried to take horses from
the Crows, we would have failed again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle turned Angry Wolf&rsquo;s words over
in his mind. It was true that fortune had
seemed to be with the Crows. They hadn&rsquo;t
been punished for the treachery they had
planned against the Sioux. Even though he
and Angry Wolf had kept the Crow plan from
succeeding, it was still an almost-victory for
the Crows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Crows should be punished,&rdquo; Little
Eagle said angrily.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf nodded. He rubbed his hand
along the side of his head where the Crow
arrow had struck him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;With the
horses we have, we can reach the winter camp.
Next spring a war party will be sent to punish
the Crows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next spring seemed far away to Little Eagle.
In his mind he could picture the party of
Crows sitting around their campfires. They
would tell of how they had tricked the Sioux
chiefs. While they hadn&rsquo;t succeeded in making
an attack, they had forced the Sioux to run.
Now they had won a victory over the Pawnees
too. Truly there would be boasting around the
Crow campfires this winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to find a better place to make
camp,&rdquo; Angry Wolf interrupted Little Eagle&rsquo;s
thoughts. &ldquo;We will want shelter against this
rain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Little Eagle had been so wrapped in his
thoughts that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed the rain. It
was only a sprinkle, but the heavy clouds in
the northwest gave promise of more to come.
Little Eagle arose and went to bring the horses.</p>
<p>He caught the horses and led them to the
place where he had left the deerskin. He rolled
their belongings into a bundle with the deerskin
around it. He mounted his horse and led
the other to Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>Little Eagle led the way across the valley to
the trail by which the Pawnees had fled from
the Crows. He turned down the trail in the
direction the Pawnees had gone. He rode
across one stream but, at the second, left the
trail and rode to a thick grove of trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make camp here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They turned their horses loose and set to
work to build a shelter. They found a clump
of small trees. By lacing the branches together,
they made a sort of lean-to to protect them
from the rain. They found a big pile of leaves
and dug into them until they came to dry ones.
These they carried to the shelter to make a bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Before they went to sleep, the two boys ate
some of the cooked meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning we&rsquo;ll have fresh meat,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf vowed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c6">CHAPTER SIX</h2>
<p>When Little Eagle awoke the next morning,
he was surprised to find the ground covered
with a light blanket of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old-man-of-the-north sent snow early,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf said, as he crawled out of the
shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; Little Eagle pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to be a warning to us,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf answered. &ldquo;Old-man-of-the-north sent it
to warn us that we should hurry to the winter
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he sent it to tell us that he would
send more to cover our tracks, if we take horses
from the Crows,&rdquo; Little Eagle suggested.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf looked at him questioningly.
Little Eagle wondered if that was fear he saw
in his friend&rsquo;s eyes. Since he had been
wounded by the Crows, Angry Wolf had acted
strangely every time the Crows were mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can lead him in a successful raid against
the Crows, he will be as brave as he has always
been,&rdquo; Little Eagle thought to himself, but he
said nothing more to Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to get fresh meat while you build a
fire,&rdquo; Angry Wolf offered.</p>
<p>Little Eagle watched as Angry Wolf left
camp. It was surprising how much better
Angry Wolf had become in the last two days.
He seemed as strong as he had ever been. It
was hard to believe that less than a moon ago
he had been seriously wounded.</p>
<p>By the time Little Eagle had a cheerful fire
going, Angry Wolf returned to camp with an
antelope on his shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hunting is good,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said, with a
pleased smile. &ldquo;This will be food enough until
we get a buffalo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they had finished eating, Little
Eagle brought the horses into camp. The sun
had risen in a clear sky and already was melting
the snow. Angry Wolf had made two packages
of the meat. One he had wrapped in the
hide of the antelope he had shot and the other
in Little Eagle&rsquo;s deer hide. He handed one of
the packages to Little Eagle.</p>
<p>Little Eagle led the way. At first the route
was up and down wooded hills, but soon the
hills became smaller and the trees fewer. When
they stopped to rest at midday, Little Eagle
could see the open prairie ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really started for our winter camp
now,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be good to be in camp with the rest
of our people,&rdquo; Little Eagle replied, trying to
forget how disappointed he was that the Crows
would go so long unpunished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Several times during the afternoon the two
boys sighted small herds of buffaloes. Little
Eagle&rsquo;s mouth watered at the sight of them.
Antelope and deer steaks were good food, but
not so good as buffalo. Every herd of buffaloes
that they sighted lumbered away before the
riders were within bowshot. Little Eagle knew
that although the buffaloes could not see far,
their keen noses quickly caught the scent of
enemies. If the wind had been blowing from
the other direction, he and Angry Wolf would
have had a chance to get one of the animals.</p>
<p>The sun was sliding down behind some
clouds in the west when Little Eagle and
Angry Wolf reached a small stream. There
were a few trees along its banks. The trees
would provide shelter and their branches
could be used for fuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I start building a shelter?&rdquo; Angry
Wolf asked.</p>
<p>As Little Eagle looked at the clouds climbing
in the western sky, he thought how much
Angry Wolf had come to depend upon him to
make all of the decisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trees will protect us,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;With my deerskin over us, we&rsquo;ll be dry even
if it should snow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>While Angry Wolf cooked meat for their
meal, Little Eagle made a pile of dry leaves
for their bed. Both of them were so tired that
as soon as they had eaten they put out the fire,
crawled into the bed of leaves, and pulled the
deerskin over them.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle awoke the next morning,
he saw that the branches of the tree were wet
and the ground around was, too. However, he
and Angry Wolf had been warm and dry in
their bed. He was pleased that there was no
snow. Perhaps Old-man-of-the-north would let
them cross the prairie before he blew snow
with his icy breath.</p>
<p>Little Eagle led the way across the open
prairie. At midday he and Angry Wolf stopped
for their usual rest. They had come a long distance
that morning, but they had seen only one
clump of trees. While they were resting, Little
Eagle watched a bank of clouds forming in the
northwest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we be rained on again this afternoon?&rdquo;
Angry Wolf asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rain will not matter,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered
uneasily. &ldquo;To me, the air has a feel as
if Old-man-of-the-north&rsquo;s cold wind was behind
that cloud. It may be a long way to the
next camping place. It would not be good to
be on the prairie if there is much snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry Wolf looked doubtfully around the
prairie where they were resting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t catch us in a much poorer place
than this,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Little Eagle agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
keep going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they started again, Little Eagle wondered
what caused his feeling of uneasiness.
The air was warmer. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be
any reason for thinking that snow would fall.
Even when the rain started, Little Eagle was
not too uncomfortable. Later in the afternoon
the rain felt colder. However, when the boys
were chilled, they jumped from their horses
and trotted beside them. As soon as they were
warm, they remounted. There was still some
daylight left when they reached a small, tree-lined
stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place for us to camp,&rdquo; Little
Eagle called cheerfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The two boys made camp quickly. As soon
as they had a fire going, they built a shelter.
It was dark by the time they had the shelter
finished. It was while they were eating that the
drops of rain began to change to flakes of snow.
In a short time the northwest wind was driving
the snow with stinging force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is fortunate that we found this place,&rdquo;
Little Eagle said. &ldquo;We may have to stay here
several days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning it looked as though Little
Eagle&rsquo;s prediction would come true. The wind
was still driving the snow before it. A drift had
buried the boys&rsquo; fire and the pile of wood.
They had to scrape the snow from the wood
and work carefully to get dry shavings to start
a new fire. Little Eagle noticed that Angry
Wolf was restless and disturbed because of the
delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old-man-of-the-north may send much
snow,&rdquo; Little Eagle told him, &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t
matter. In a few days much of it will melt.
Then we can travel easily.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Old-man-of-the-north sends one snow,
he will send others,&rdquo; Angry Wolf protested.
&ldquo;We may be caught on the prairie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be the last snow of this moon,&rdquo;
Little Eagle stated with certainty.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf seemed much encouraged by
Little Eagle&rsquo;s words. He took his quiver of
arrows and began smoothing some of the arrows.
Little Eagle spent his time rewrapping
the hand grip on his bow. About midday the
snow slackened, and soon afterward it almost
stopped. Little Eagle stood up and looked
about. In some places drifts of snow had been
piled high. In others, the ground had been
swept almost bare. Although the wind was
cold, rays of sunshine filtered through the
clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see about our horses,&rdquo; Little
Eagle announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish scraping my arrows unless you
want me to go with you,&rdquo; Angry Wolf decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go alone,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered.
&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t far away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>However, Little Eagle walked a considerable
distance from camp without finding a
trace of the horses. He couldn&rsquo;t even find the
trail they had left when they wandered away.
When the sun was getting low in the western
sky, Little Eagle turned back toward camp. On
the way back, he wondered what words he
would use to tell Angry Wolf so that the other
boy would not be too alarmed at the danger of
their situation. Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t try to hide
from himself the fact that they were in grave
danger. Here in the middle of the prairie,
with no horses, they might not be able to get
enough game to keep them alive through the
winter.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Angry Wolf was not greatly
disturbed when Little Eagle announced that
he hadn&rsquo;t been able to find the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They probably drifted ahead of the storm,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf said calmly. &ldquo;In the morning we&rsquo;ll
both look for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning the two boys left camp
together. When they had gone about a third of
the distance Little Eagle had covered the day
before, they halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go south here,&rdquo; Little Eagle
suggested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go farther east and then I&rsquo;ll
turn south.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Little Eagle went almost as far east as he had
gone yesterday before he turned south. He
plodded slowly through the deep snow. He
climbed and crossed many low hills without
finding the horses. As he climbed to the top of
another hill, he decided he would turn back
toward Angry Wolf and search the ground
between them. From the top of the hill Little
Eagle could see a clump of trees below him. It
was possible that the horses were crowded into
the shelter of the trees and were hidden from
his sight. He decided to look behind the trees.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle circled the trees, he saw
the tracks of the horses leading south. He
hurried forward to get a better look at the trail
they had left. He saw that the horses had left
the grove while snow was still falling. Their
tracks were partly covered with snow. He
stopped in dismay when he saw that the tracks
had been made by three horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Little Eagle made a quick search under the
trees. He found where someone had camped
during the worst of the storm. He was not
good enough at tracking to read all of the signs,
but he could read enough of them to tell that
someone had been camping here and that the
horses had wandered to the shelter of the trees
during the storm. Whoever had been here had
taken the horses and ridden on while the snow
was still falling.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take any sign reading for Little
Eagle to realize how great a misfortune had
befallen Angry Wolf and himself. There was
no hope that they could get the horses back. It
would be equally hopeless to try to cross the
prairie on foot. They would have to turn back
to where there were more trees. He and Angry
Wolf would have to spend the winter by themselves.</p>
<p>Little Eagle turned west to find Angry
Wolf&rsquo;s trail. When he reached it, he followed
it south. He went as swiftly as he could go.
Angry Wolf glanced back and saw him. The
other boy turned back to meet Little Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the horses?&rdquo; Angry Wolf asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone took them,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>As Little Eagle told of the trail he had
found, he closely watched Angry Wolf&rsquo;s face.
He saw fear in the other boy&rsquo;s eyes, and he
tried to make his voice cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a Crow warrior who took our
horses,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said hopelessly when
Little Eagle had finished. &ldquo;The Crows have
powerful medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to get those horses back,&rdquo; Little
Eagle urged.</p>
<p>Little Eagle spoke with a confidence he
didn&rsquo;t feel. He had no plan for getting the
horses, yet he knew he must say something to
encourage Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crows have powerful medicine,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old-man-of-the-north might send another
snow to keep the Crow in camp until we get
our horses back from him,&rdquo; Little Eagle suggested.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf glanced around the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no more snow this moon,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We may as well return to our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Without a word, Little Eagle turned back
toward their own camp. While Angry Wolf
was in this mood, it would do no good to argue
with him. Perhaps when he had eaten and
rested, he would see that their best hope to
escape would be to get their horses back from
the Crow.</p>
<p>As soon as they reached camp, Angry Wolf
began to slice thin pieces of meat and put them
on a stick. Little Eagle saw that Angry Wolf
was cooking enough food for a trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be foolish for us to try to cross the
prairie on foot,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf nodded agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our best plan is to return to the camp we
had on the creek,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m preparing
extra food in case we have trouble reaching the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Little Eagle busied himself with
work around the camp, he turned the problem
over in his mind. He knew Angry Wolf would
agree to wait until morning to start the return
trip. In the meantime he had to think of a plan
to get their horses from the Crow. It would
have to be a good plan if it convinced Angry
Wolf. Angry Wolf had said that the Crows had
powerful medicine. Yet the two of them had
spoiled the Crow plan to attack the Sioux
camp. Perhaps their own medicine was as
strong as that of the Crows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Little Eagle sat down a few paces from the
fire. He wanted to think more about this problem.
He tried to imagine what advice Clawing
Bear would give. When the answer came, it
was almost as if Clawing Bear were speaking
to him. He had the deer hide. It was powerful
medicine. He should take the hide and go
away from camp. If he rolled himself up in
the deer hide and slept, he might have a dream
which would tell him what to do. He told his
thoughts to Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have studied under the great medicine
man, Clawing Bear,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;You should know more about
these matters than I. Yet, if you don&rsquo;t get a
clear dream, we ought to start back to the old
camp at daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>As soon as darkness fell, Little Eagle carried
his deer hide to the top of a high hill. He was
so far from camp that he couldn&rsquo;t see the twinkle
of the fire. When he had thought of the
plan, Little Eagle hadn&rsquo;t thought of the danger.
As he pulled the deer hide over him, he
felt uneasy. He had never had a visit from a
spirit. Suppose he was frightened? It would be
a disgrace for a Sioux boy to show fear.</p>
<p>At first he moved about restlessly. The wind
seemed to creep under the hide and keep him
cold. After a time he had the deer hide arranged
so that the wind didn&rsquo;t get under it. As
soon as he was warm, he grew drowsy. He had
almost fallen asleep when a faint sighing noise
aroused him. He listened tensely. After a few
minutes he realized the sound was made by
the wind sifting snow against the deer hide. He
closed his eyes and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Afterward Little Eagle was never sure
whether he woke up, as he seemed to do, or
whether the whole thing was a dream. At least
it was so real that it seemed to happen. He felt
cold. When he opened his eyes he saw that it
was still dark. He realized that the deer hide
had slipped off his shoulder. He reached his
hand out to grasp it and pull it back over his
shoulder. He stopped when a soft voice spoke
to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Little Eagle,&rdquo; the voice said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you how you can get horses from the
Crows. They are my enemies too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle sat up. It wasn&rsquo;t as dark as he
had thought. The eastern sky was beginning to
lighten. It wouldn&rsquo;t be long until the sun came
up. Little Eagle looked around, but he could
see no one. The only living thing near was a
small bird which sat huddled on his deerskin.
When the voice spoke again, Little Eagle saw
that it was the bird speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crows have killed many buffaloes,&rdquo;
the bird said. &ldquo;They are gorged with food. It
will be easy to take horses from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle scrambled to his feet. He could
dash back to camp and get Angry Wolf. Together
they would follow the bird and get
horses. He reached down to pick up the deer
hide to carry it back to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it under that tree,&rdquo; the bird said, nodding
his head toward a tree in the direction
away from the camp. &ldquo;My family will use it to
build warm nests for the winter which is almost
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Little Eagle folded the skin neatly. The bird
flew ahead and perched on a limb while Little
Eagle placed the hide at the foot of the tree.
The bird flew off to the west. He went so
quickly that Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t have time to
ask for permission to get Angry Wolf. He had
to run to keep the bird in sight.</p>
<p>While it didn&rsquo;t seem that they had traveled
long, the sun was down and darkness had
fallen when they reached the Crow camp. The
camp had been set up on the sheltered side of a
grove of trees. The smell of roasting buffalo
meat made Little Eagle&rsquo;s mouth water. A few
Crows were feasting on the fresh buffalo meat.
Little Eagle knew that most of the band had
stuffed themselves with fresh meat and had
crawled into their tepees to sleep.</p>
<p>The bird flew around the Crow camp, and
Little Eagle followed him. In a short time they
came to the herd of horses. Little Eagle saw
the ones that belonged to Angry Wolf and
him. He guessed that the warrior who had
taken them had gone south until the storm
stopped and then had circled to join the
Crows in this camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;See how easily you can take all the horses
you want,&rdquo; the bird whispered.</p>
<p>Little Eagle looked around. What the bird
said was true. There were no guards. Most of
the horses were out of sight of the camp. Anyone
who used reasonable care could take horses
from this herd.</p>
<p>Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t know what happened
after that. He was chilly and he awoke to find
that the deer hide had slipped from his shoulder.
He sat up. The sun was just rising over
the eastern hills. His dream had been so plain
that for a moment he couldn&rsquo;t believe it had
been a dream.</p>
<p>Little Eagle&rsquo;s first feeling was of disappointment.
It had been a dream and he didn&rsquo;t
actually have the horses. The feeling of disappointment
passed quickly. He had heard Clawing
Bear tell of the messages that came to a
medicine man in dreams. This was a message
for him. He had learned how he and Angry
Wolf could get horses. He jumped to his feet
and raced to camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Angry Wolf had already risen. He was cooking
more meat at the fire. He looked sad and
dejected as Little Eagle ran into camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had a message?&rdquo; he asked doubtfully
when he saw Little Eagle&rsquo;s excitement.</p>
<p>Little Eagle nodded. Eagerly, he related
what had happened in his dream. When he had
finished, he saw that Angry Wolf was still unconvinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the messenger a blackbird?&rdquo; Angry
Wolf demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered. &ldquo;It was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped. In his excitement he hadn&rsquo;t
noticed what kind of a bird it had been. He
was sure it wasn&rsquo;t a blackbird. He would have
known better than to follow one of those
bringers of misfortune, even in a dream. Then
he remembered that the bird had said, &ldquo;The
Crows are my enemies too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mud swallow,&rdquo; Little Eagle exclaimed.
&ldquo;It told me that the Crows were its
enemies too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is better,&rdquo; Angry Wolf admitted.
&ldquo;The Crows shoot the swallows, and we never
do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are ready to accept the sign and
try to get horses from the Crows?&rdquo; Little Eagle
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure it is a sign,&rdquo; Angry Wolf answered
slowly. &ldquo;It may just be a dream with
no meaning.&rdquo; He stood up. &ldquo;We have to have
horses, though. I am willing to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of Angry Wolf&rsquo;s doubts, Little
Eagle was so excited that he could hardly eat.
He reminded himself that it had been a long
journey in his dream. He would need all of his
strength, so he forced himself to eat as much as
if he were hungry.</p>
<p>As soon as Angry Wolf was ready, Little
Eagle led the way. He went to the hill where
he had spent the night. He picked up the deerskin,
folded it carefully, and put it under the
tree, as he had done in his dream. In his dream
Little Eagle had gone so swiftly that he hadn&rsquo;t
noticed the landmarks. Now there was nothing
to guide him. He remembered that he had
gone west and a little south. He tried to take
the same direction.</p>
<p>As the sun began to sink low in the west,
Angry Wolf watched anxiously ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;We should be nearing the place,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was almost dark when the bird and I got
there,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered. &ldquo;We can go
many paces before darkness falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said the Crows were camped near
trees,&rdquo; Angry Wolf reminded him. &ldquo;We have
seen no trees since we started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same fear had been nagging at Little
Eagle. In his dream the Crows had been
camped behind a grove of trees. Yet he and
Angry Wolf had traveled all day without seeing
trees and there seemed to be none ahead.</p>
<p>The two of them came to the top of a high
hill. Far ahead of them they saw a grove of
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the place,&rdquo; Little Eagle exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better rest and eat,&rdquo; Angry Wolf suggested.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t take horses until after darkness
falls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>They found a place where the sun had
melted the snow and dried the ground. Here
they ate the cold meat they had brought with
them. For the first time since they had started,
Angry Wolf seemed to think they had a chance
to succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we have horses again, we&rsquo;ll hunt
buffaloes,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other meat is so good,&rdquo; Little Eagle
answered.</p>
<p>They rested until the darkness was heavy
enough to hide their movements. It didn&rsquo;t take
them long to reach the grove of trees. They
could see the gleam of campfires on the other
side of the grove.</p>
<p>The two Sioux slipped among the trees until
they reached a place where they could see
the Crow camp. There were several campfires,
and chunks of buffalo meat were roasting over
each of them. Some warriors were sitting
around, gorging on fresh meat. Others had
evidently stuffed themselves and crawled into
their tepees to sleep. As Little Eagle and Angry
Wolf watched, one of the warriors got to
his feet and staggered to a tepee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Little Eagle knew that sometimes warriors,
who had been without food for several days,
would stuff themselves with fresh meat when
they had the chance. Warriors who did that
would sleep soundly. He and Angry Wolf
should be able to take horses without trouble.</p>
<p>Little Eagle touched Angry Wolf&rsquo;s arm. He
began to circle the camp, with Angry Wolf
following him. They went around the west
side of the camp and continued south until
they came to the herd of horses. Even in the
darkness they located the two that had been
taken from them.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf took a careful look around. He
motioned for Little Eagle to stay where he was.
Little Eagle waited patiently as Angry Wolf
slipped away in the darkness. While he was
sure there were no guards watching the herd,
Little Eagle realized that Angry Wolf was
doing what should be done. A warrior should
look for his enemies even when he didn&rsquo;t expect
to find them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no guards,&rdquo; Angry Wolf whispered
when he returned.</p>
<p>The two boys went straight to their own
horses. The horses stood quietly while their
riders mounted. Angry Wolf wanted to take at
least ten horses apiece, but Little Eagle objected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a better chance to get away if
we pick a few good horses,&rdquo; he pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more horses we take, the greater our
victory,&rdquo; Angry Wolf whispered urgently.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of whispering together,
Angry Wolf agreed to accept Little Eagle&rsquo;s
plan to take five horses apiece. When the
horses had been selected, Angry Wolf took the
halter ropes of two of them and started away
from the camp. Little Eagle rode behind, herding
the others. Now the wisdom of Little
Eagle&rsquo;s plan was plain, for even the few horses
were hard to get started. Little Eagle&rsquo;s horse
was kept turning and plunging to hold the
horses in a bunch.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf rode straight west until he saw
that Little Eagle had the herd under control.
Then he turned north, as they had decided to
do. There was no chance to pick a route where
they wouldn&rsquo;t leave a trail. Even in the places
where there was no snow, the tracks of the
horses could easily be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>After they had ridden for what seemed a
long time, Little Eagle called for Angry Wolf
to stop. Little Eagle circled the herd and rode
to his friend&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn east here,&rdquo; Little Eagle ordered.
&ldquo;We may be able to fool the Crows into thinking
we are Pawnees. If we do, they&rsquo;ll turn
south to cut us off. We will soon turn north
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have won a great victory over the
Crows,&rdquo; Angry Wolf gloated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will win a great victory if we get away,&rdquo;
Little Eagle answered grimly. &ldquo;The Crows
will follow us when they learn of their loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that time we shall have escaped,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf said hopefully.</p>
<p>Little Eagle looked at his friend in wonder.
For days, Angry Wolf had been downhearted
and gloomy. He had thought they had no
chance against the Crows. Now that they had
made this little start, Angry Wolf had completely
changed. He already counted the victory
won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t sing the Victory Song until we
are sure we have escaped,&rdquo; Little Eagle said
quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c7">CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
<p>As he rode east, Little Eagle felt more and
more uneasy. This plan of his might not be so
good. If the Crows guessed that it was Sioux
and not Pawnees they were chasing, they
would take a more direct route. Or they might
send one party to follow the trail and the other
to take a shorter route. It might well be that
his plan would actually make it easier for the
Crows to catch them.</p>
<p>Little Eagle felt easier in his mind when he
turned north. As the eastern sky began to
light up, he felt still better. He and Angry
Wolf had come a long way from the Crow
camp. It might be that the Crows hadn&rsquo;t yet
learned of their loss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>As the sun came up, Little Eagle called a
halt. He noticed Angry Wolf&rsquo;s anxious look as
the horses scattered to graze. Little Eagle unwrapped
the last of their supply of meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For our next meal we&rsquo;ll have buffalo
meat,&rdquo; he said, trying to rouse Angry Wolf
from his gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Crows catch us, we won&rsquo;t have a next
meal,&rdquo; Angry Wolf answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crows won&rsquo;t catch us,&rdquo; Little Eagle
insisted. &ldquo;We took the horses easily, just as the
mud swallow in my dream told me we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; Angry Wolf agreed. &ldquo;But the
swallow didn&rsquo;t show you how we were to escape
after we had the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle frowned. A short time ago
Angry Wolf had been full of confidence. He
had wanted to sing the Victory Song. Now he
was sure that they couldn&rsquo;t succeed. It was true
that his dream had ended without the swallow
showing him how to escape with the horses.
Suddenly Little Eagle&rsquo;s frown changed to a
smile of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mud swallow is an enemy of the
Crows,&rdquo; Little Eagle reminded his friend. &ldquo;He
won&rsquo;t let them catch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Angry Wolf replied
doubtfully. &ldquo;Anyway I think we should sleep
before we start on. We need rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle wondered if Angry Wolf&rsquo;s plan
was good. The Crows would soon be on their
trail. Every step he and Angry Wolf went now
would be another step away from their enemies.
If the Crows started while he and Angry
Wolf slept, they would be cutting down the
distance between them. But they did need the
rest. Besides, Angry Wolf should make some of
the decisions. He stretched out on the ground
and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Little Eagle sat up sleepily when Angry
Wolf touched his arm. He felt as though he
had just closed his eyes, yet when he looked to
the east, he saw the sun high above the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must start,&rdquo; Angry Wolf urged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>It took the two of them a long time to catch
horses to ride and drive the others into a herd.
When they were ready to start, Little Eagle
again took the lead.</p>
<p>They had trouble keeping the herd moving
fast. Sometimes the horses would trot, but
most of the time they plodded along at a walk.
Often one of the horses tried to turn back.
Angry Wolf had to be constantly alert.</p>
<p>When the sun was straight overhead, Little
Eagle didn&rsquo;t stop for their usual rest. He did
signal for Angry Wolf to take the lead, and he
rode behind the horses.</p>
<p>Whenever they crossed a hill, Little Eagle
stopped to look back. As the day wore on and
he saw no signs of Crows, he began to feel
more confident. It was nearly dark by the time
they stopped beside a small stream. Little
Eagle felt almost safe. He was even more encouraged
by Angry Wolf&rsquo;s growing cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to have escaped,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;You could hunt for fresh meat while I
build a fire,&rdquo; Little Eagle suggested, hoping
that by keeping Angry Wolf busy, he could
keep him in good spirits.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf was gone only a short time. He
came back with one rabbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dark to hunt,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry that rabbit will taste as good
as roasted buffalo tongue,&rdquo; Little Eagle assured
him.</p>
<p>As soon as the rabbit was cooked, Little
Eagle covered the fire with dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to give the Crows a signal
if they are following us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Little Eagle was glad that there were no
clouds in the sky. Since he had left the deer
hide for the swallows, they had no cover. As
long as there was no snow or rain, he and
Angry Wolf could sleep comfortably by burrowing
into a pile of leaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>When Little Eagle awoke the next morning,
he felt like jumping and shouting. It seemed
that he ought to dance the Victory Dance.
He and Angry Wolf had escaped the Crows.
The horses they had taken were proof of a
great victory. Because Angry Wolf was already
rounding up the horses, Little Eagle
delayed his celebration. He hurried to help
the other boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to get a buffalo,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said
when they had the horses driven together in
a herd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re hunting, I&rsquo;ll ride back to the
top of the first hill,&rdquo; Little Eagle told him.
&ldquo;From there I can see a long way. If there are
no Crows in sight, we can feel safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle would much rather have gone
with Angry Wolf to hunt buffaloes. It was
almost certain that they had escaped the
Crows. Yet he had been taught that a warrior
must always guard against surprise.</p>
<p>The hill rose to a high, pointed peak. Little
Eagle rode half way up it. Here he dismounted.
He crept up the last few paces to
the top as carefully as though he expected to
see Crows coming up the other side. He took
a long time to study the trail. Nothing moved
along it. At last he returned to his horse,
mounted, and rode back to camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Little Eagle had been in camp only a short
time when Angry Wolf rode in, carrying a
piece of buffalo meat. Angry Wolf rode triumphantly.
All of his gloom of the evening
before was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring in the rest of the buffalo meat
as soon as we have eaten,&rdquo; he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have done well,&rdquo; Little Eagle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Angry Wolf exclaimed. &ldquo;We have
won victories over the Pawnees and Crows.
Hunting has been good. We ought to sing
the Victory Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a short time ago, Little Eagle had
thought they should sing the Victory Song.
Now, as Angry Wolf became surer that they
had escaped, Little Eagle began to feel new
doubts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better wait another day,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I think we have escaped the Crows, but
surely after one more day there can be no
doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry Wolf didn&rsquo;t act greatly disappointed.
He seemed to feel that one more day before
they sang the Victory Song would make little
difference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Before they started on, Little Eagle helped
Angry Wolf bring in the rest of the buffalo
meat. They cut the buffalo hide into two
pieces. They placed the meat on the pieces
of hide, then wrapped the hide around the
meat so that each piece of hide made a big
bundle. They tied the two bundles on one
of the horses. This time Angry Wolf led the
way, while Little Eagle rode behind to keep
the herd moving.</p>
<p>The prairie here was different from that
they had been crossing. The hills were higher
and closer together. It seemed to Little Eagle
that they were always either going up a hill
or down one. He was glad that they seemed
to be safely away from the Crows. Here a
party of enemies might have ridden close before
he or Angry Wolf discovered them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>All morning they seldom saw a tree. They
crossed a few spring-fed streams, but even beside
these there was hardly ever a tree. Little
Eagle and Angry Wolf continually traded
places so that part of the time Little Eagle
rode ahead and led the way, while at other
times he rode behind. About the middle of
the afternoon he was riding behind. The
horses had given so little trouble that he paid
them scant attention. He was humming the
Victory Song under his breath when, for some
reason, he glanced back. A lone Crow warrior
was charging toward him!</p>
<p>Little Eagle acted swiftly. He shouted a
warning to Angry Wolf and at the same time
jabbed his right knee against his horse&rsquo;s side
to whirl it around to face the Crow. As his
horse whirled, Little Eagle brought up his
bow. There was no time to take aim. The
Crow was almost upon him. Little Eagle let
his arrow fly just as the Crow&rsquo;s arrow struck
him. Little Eagle felt a cutting, tearing pain
in his right arm or shoulder, and the force
of the arrow almost tore him from his horse.
He clutched the horse&rsquo;s mane to keep from
falling.</p>
<p>In a half daze Little Eagle realized that he
had dropped his own bow. He heard the
pound of hoofs as the Crow circled and came
back. Little Eagle tried to sit erectly on his
horse. He could do nothing to defend himself,
but he would meet death like a Sioux warrior.
The Crow swept past without taking another
shot. It was then that Little Eagle saw the
Crow had been struck with an arrow too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Angry Wolf dashed past in pursuit of the
Crow, but he couldn&rsquo;t get near the wounded
warrior. He fired two arrows, but both of them
went wide of the mark. Little Eagle dimly
realized that Angry Wolf pulled his horse to
a stop at the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t know how long Angry
Wolf was gone. He felt himself falling. He
braced himself with the hand that held the
horse&rsquo;s mane and fought against the darkness
that was closing in on him. The wave of darkness
passed, and Little Eagle was still on his
horse.</p>
<p>When he felt stronger, Little Eagle took
his hand from his horse&rsquo;s mane and felt of
the wound. His fingers touched a shaft of
wood. The arrow was stuck in his arm. The
head had gone through the flesh, but the shaft
hadn&rsquo;t. Little Eagle felt the darkness closing
in again, but he fought it off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>It took a long time for Little Eagle to get
up enough courage to try to pull the arrow
out. When he reached for it, he heard a horse
approaching. He looked up and saw Angry
Wolf returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the Crow&rsquo;s arrow had killed
you,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said as he came near Little
Eagle.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf&rsquo;s eyes widened, and a look of
fear came into them when he saw the arrow
stuck through Little Eagle&rsquo;s arm and the blood
running down from the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me off my horse,&rdquo; Little Eagle
ordered.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf jumped from his horse to obey.
Little Eagle clamped his teeth together. He
held out his good hand to Angry Wolf. With
the other boy&rsquo;s help he got off his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take the arrow out of my
wound,&rdquo; he told Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf looked at the arrow. His face
was drawn and he was gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I get it out?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a careful hold of it with both hands,&rdquo;
Little Eagle answered. &ldquo;Snap it in two and
pull the rest out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Little Eagle took a deep breath as Angry
Wolf took hold of the arrow. He felt a stab
of hot pain as Angry Wolf broke the arrow.
In spite of himself, Little Eagle gasped as
Angry Wolf drew the rest of the arrow from
the wound. Little Eagle kept his head turned
aside until he was able to smile. When he
looked toward his friend, he saw that Angry
Wolf&rsquo;s face had the same sickly color it had
had when he had been wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did a Crow arrow hit you too?&rdquo; Little
Eagle demanded.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid the Crow&rsquo;s arrow had taken
you to the Happy Hunting Grounds,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Then, as though afraid he had shown too
much feeling, Angry Wolf spoke sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how to take care of your wound,&rdquo;
he snapped. &ldquo;You have studied under Clawing
Bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle forced himself to look at his
wound. It was a ragged hole, and blood was
oozing down both sides of his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the material for another poultice,&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;But it must be cooked. There
is no fuel here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Angry Wolf looked around. There was
grass that he could gather and twist into knots.
Although it would be slow work, they could
build a cooking fire with it. He raised his eyes
and looked ahead. As far ahead as he could
see, the prairie looked the same. Yet it might
not be far to a stream that had trees growing
beside it. That would be a safer place to camp
than this open ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you ride?&rdquo; Angry Wolf asked, turning
toward Little Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered.</p>
<p>Little Eagle spoke stoutly, but when he
tried to mount his horse, he wasn&rsquo;t able. He
had to have Angry Wolf&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ride in front,&rdquo; Angry Wolf directed.
&ldquo;Go as straight north as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new thought suddenly struck Little Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Crow get away?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was still on his horse when it went
out of sight,&rdquo; Angry Wolf answered. &ldquo;But
your arrow has wounded him badly. I don&rsquo;t
think he will get back to the Crow camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;There might be other Crows near who
would come to avenge him,&rdquo; Little Eagle
pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no other Crows near,&rdquo; Angry
Wolf answered positively. &ldquo;If there had been,
they would have joined in the attack on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle nodded. No warrior would
have been foolish enough to make an attack
alone when other warriors were near who
could help him. He turned his horse and
started off.</p>
<p>At first Little Eagle was able to ride without
too much trouble. It wasn&rsquo;t long, though,
until the journey became a torture. The
wound in his arm made his whole body hurt.
He had lost so much blood that he was weak
and lightheaded. It took all of his remaining
strength to stay on his horse. Weary step after
weary step he held on, but at last he could
hold on no longer. He slid from his horse.</p>
<p>Although Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t know about
it, Angry Wolf lifted him onto his own horse.
He mounted behind Little Eagle and held
him. Angry Wolf rode off without a look at
the herd of horses. He hoped they would follow,
but if they didn&rsquo;t, it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/i5.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="692" />
<p class="caption"><i>He added the powdered herbs and the bear&rsquo;s grease</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>There was still daylight when Angry Wolf
sighted trees ahead. Before he reached the
grove of trees, he saw that they were growing
along a stream. When he reached the grove,
he gently lifted Little Eagle to the ground.
He dug the bowl from one of the packs and
filled it at the stream. He held the bowl to
Little Eagle&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>Little Eagle opened his eyes and drank.
Angry Wolf smiled briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll build a fire,&rdquo; Angry Wolf told him.
&ldquo;You will tell me how to fix the poultice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t try to answer. He lay
back with his eyes closed. When Angry Wolf
stepped over to tell him the fire was ready,
Little Eagle opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift me up,&rdquo; Little Eagle ordered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
help you make the poultice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry Wolf opened the sack which contained
the material for the poultice. Under
Little Eagle&rsquo;s direction, he added the powdered
herbs and the bear&rsquo;s grease and stirred
them until the poultice was cooked. He set
it off the fire and waited until it cooled enough
so that he could handle it. Little Eagle helped
him press the poultice over the wound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Both boys looked anxiously to the south as
they heard the sound of approaching horses.
They exchanged pleased smiles when they saw
the horses they had taken from the Crows
come to the stream. All of the horses, except
the one with packs, drank at the stream. Angry
Wolf quickly took the packs off the other horse
so that it could join the herd.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf sliced steaks from the buffalo
meat and cooked them over the fire. When
they were done, he fed Little Eagle before he
ate any himself.</p>
<p>When he had eaten, Little Eagle had Angry
Wolf help him lie down. He fell asleep almost
as soon as his head touched the ground. Several
times the pain in his shoulder awakened
him. However, toward morning he fell into a
deep sleep. He awoke with a throbbing pain
in his shoulder, but he felt surprisingly strong.
He sat up carefully.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf, who had been cooking meat,
rushed anxiously to Little Eagle&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am better,&rdquo; Little Eagle assured him.</p>
<p>Little Eagle got slowly to his feet. Although
he felt weak, he managed to walk to the stream.
He felt better after he had washed himself
and had drunk of the clear water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should sing the Victory Song as soon
as your arm is healed,&rdquo; Angry Wolf suggested,
as they were eating the meat he had cooked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait until we reach winter camp,&rdquo;
Little Eagle said. &ldquo;Other times we thought
that we had escaped the Crows, and we were
ready to sing the Victory Song, yet that one
warrior was following.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the last,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said confidently.
&ldquo;But you have proved yourself a
good leader. We shall wait until you are ready
to sing the Victory Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that warrior was wounded by my
arrow,&rdquo; Little Eagle said. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Angry Wolf replied. &ldquo;The Crow was
wounded when he rode toward me. I didn&rsquo;t
get close enough to him to get a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I get my bow back?&rdquo; Little Eagle
asked. &ldquo;I seem to remember dropping it when
I was hit by the arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;I picked it up,&rdquo; Angry Wolf explained.</p>
<p>All day Little Eagle was restless. Several
times he wanted to suggest that they go on.
The Crows were bitter enemies. It might well
be that when the warrior didn&rsquo;t return, they&rsquo;d
send a party to search for him. When they
found him, they would look for their enemies
so that they could take revenge. Angry Wolf
seemed to feel that it was safe to rest in camp.
He did mount one of the horses and ride a
scouting trip around the camp. When he returned,
he stretched out on the ground and
slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we start in the morning?&rdquo; Little
Eagle asked as they were eating that evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we should stay here another
day so there will be no danger of reopening
your wound?&rdquo; Angry Wolf suggested.</p>
<p>Little Eagle nodded reluctant agreement.
His arm still throbbed painfully. He had used
the last of his material to make the poultice
for this wound. It would be better to make
sure the wound was healed before they started.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>The one day became two. Both days dragged
slowly for Little Eagle. Much of the time he
was thinking of Clawing Bear and the many
things yet to be learned from the medicine
man. Late in the afternoon of the second day,
Little Eagle picked up his bow and shot a few
arrows at a slender sapling. He couldn&rsquo;t draw
the bow as well as he had before, but it seemed
good to be able to use it at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can start tomorrow,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said
with a smile, as he watched Little Eagle.</p>
<p>That night they had a feast of buffalo meat.
Angry Wolf cooked all that they could eat.
When they had had enough, he put a small
piece aside to cook for their morning meal.
The rest he made into packs to be put on
one of the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It still seems strange to me that the Crows
haven&rsquo;t sent a war party to catch us,&rdquo; Little
Eagle told his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are far into Sioux land,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
replied. &ldquo;They are afraid to come this far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would know that most of our people
are in winter camp by this time,&rdquo; Little Eagle
pointed out. &ldquo;They would be in little danger
of meeting one of our war parties.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re still chasing the Pawnees,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more likely that by this time they
know it was two Sioux boys who took their
horses,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered. &ldquo;We must
have left signs that told&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle had been looking into the fire.
He stopped speaking when he seemed to see
a party of Crows riding in the fire just as he
had seen them in Clawing Bear&rsquo;s fire. Angry
Wolf gave him a surprised look and then bent
forward to look into the fire too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see in the fire?&rdquo; Angry Wolf
demanded.</p>
<p>As Angry Wolf spoke, the Crows disappeared
in the coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a party of Crows riding hard,&rdquo; Little
Eagle replied. &ldquo;It is the same sign I saw in
Clawing Bear&rsquo;s fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which direction were they riding?&rdquo; Angry
Wolf asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered.
&ldquo;When you spoke, they disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it be a sign that they have given
up and are riding toward their own winter
camp?&rdquo; Angry Wolf suggested.</p>
<p>Little Eagle looked thoughtfully into the
fire. What Angry Wolf had suggested might
be right, but he knew at once that it wasn&rsquo;t.
The other time he had seen the Crows in the
flames, it had been a warning. This must be
a warning too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sign that the Crows are still chasing
us,&rdquo; Little Eagle insisted.</p>
<p>As he spoke, Little Eagle glanced at his
friend. He saw the doubt in Angry Wolf&rsquo;s
eyes. The look of doubt slowly faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have studied with a great medicine
man,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said. &ldquo;You may have misread
this sign, but we must make sure. Before
we start in the morning, I will make a scouting
trip far back on our old trail. If the Crows
are on it, we must know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c8">CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
<p>At the first sign of dawn the next morning,
Angry Wolf arose. Little Eagle heard him and
immediately crawled out of his own pile of
leaves. Together they went to the herd of
horses. As soon as they caught a horse, Angry
Wolf mounted and rode off.</p>
<p>Little Eagle caught another horse. Riding
it, he drove the horses together into a herd.
He brought the herd close to camp. While he
waited for Angry Wolf to return, Little Eagle
busied himself around the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>As the sun climbed above the eastern hills,
Little Eagle worried about Angry Wolf. Angry
Wolf had been gone long enough to ride far
back on their trail. Little Eagle tried to check
his rising fears by reminding himself that
camping places were far apart. If Angry Wolf
rode all the way back to their last camping
place, he would be gone some time yet.</p>
<p>The horses had separated to graze. Little
Eagle mounted one of them and drove them
into a herd again. He returned to the campfire
to wait as patiently as he could. All of the
time that he waited, he was wishing that he
had taken more lessons from Clawing Bear.
The old medicine man would have known
the meaning of the sign he had seen in the
fire. If Clawing Bear had been with them, he
could have told them what to do. Then there
would have been no need for Angry Wolf to
make that long trip back down the trail.</p>
<p>When Angry Wolf came into sight, Little
Eagle knew at once that the other boy had
exciting news. He was riding his horse as fast
as it could go. Angry Wolf pulled the horse
to a stop and jumped off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big war party of Crows back at
the last spring we passed,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may turn back without coming this
far,&rdquo; Little Eagle suggested. &ldquo;Our trail there
is old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come to this stream,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
stated as positively as if he had heard the
Crows planning. &ldquo;Here they will find the new
trail we will make as we leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle saw the wisdom of the other&rsquo;s
words. The Crows knew of this stream. Probably
they had planned to camp here but had
been delayed on the way. If the warrior who
had attacked Angry Wolf and him had been
able to return to camp, he had reported to
them. If the man hadn&rsquo;t returned to camp,
the other Crows had found his body by now.
Yes, they would come on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to leave the horses we have
captured,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t drive
a herd of horses and outrun the Crows. They
have swift horses and strong medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have powerful medicine if I
had studied more with Clawing Bear,&rdquo; Little
Eagle thought to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Aloud he said, &ldquo;They may catch us even
if we leave the other horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may,&rdquo; Angry Wolf agreed grimly.</p>
<p>Little Eagle looked toward the herd of
horses. It had seemed a great victory when he
and Angry Wolf had escaped with them. He
remembered how he and Angry Wolf had
wanted to sing the Victory Song. Now the
Crows would get the horses back. It would
be a tremendous triumph for them. Little
Eagle had pictured in his own mind how
proud he would be to ride into winter camp
with the herd of captured ponies. But it
wouldn&rsquo;t happen. The Crows were going to
win again.</p>
<p>Little Eagle&rsquo;s face set with determination.
He and Angry Wolf could lie in ambush. They
couldn&rsquo;t defeat the big Crow war party, but
they could make the Crows pay for their victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Crows take our scalps, it will make
them an even greater victory,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
said as though he were reading Little Eagle&rsquo;s
thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo; Little Eagle had to agree.
&ldquo;However, if Clawing Bear were here, he
would think of a plan to defeat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clawing Bear is a great medicine man,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf acknowledged.</p>
<p>Little Eagle gave a start. It was almost as
though Clawing Bear had whispered in his
ear. Sioux medicine was powerful too. There
was a way that might fool the Crows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take the Crows to reach
here?&rdquo; Little Eagle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were starting to cook their meal
when I saw them,&rdquo; Angry Wolf replied. &ldquo;They
will stop to study the place where we were
attacked. We may have until the sun is straight
overhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must build many fires to make it look
as though this is a big Sioux camp,&rdquo; Little
Eagle explained. &ldquo;The Crows will turn back
if they think many Sioux are camped here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see this is no camp when they cross
those hills,&rdquo; Angry Wolf objected, pointing
back to the hills their trail had crossed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see the smoke of the fires before
they reach the hills,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered.
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t cross the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;The plan might work,&rdquo; Angry Wolf agreed
doubtfully.</p>
<p>They went to work at once. Fires were laid
as they would be in a Sioux camp. As quickly
as a pile of wood was ready, one of the boys
brought coals and started it. In a short time
they had a score of fires lifting spirals of smoke
into the crisp morning air. When the Crows
counted those spirals of smoke, they surely
would turn back. They wouldn&rsquo;t risk a battle
with a large Sioux war party.</p>
<p>As soon as the fires were started, Little Eagle
and Angry Wolf mounted their horses. Little
Eagle signed for Angry Wolf to take the lead.
For a moment he thought the older boy was
going to refuse to take the less dangerous
place, but Angry Wolf took his place without
protest. He set a swift pace, and Little Eagle
forced the other horses to keep up with Angry
Wolf&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Each time they crossed a hill, Little Eagle
stopped to look back. Every time Little Eagle
stopped, Angry Wolf turned his head to watch
for a signal. They moved on in this way as the
sun crossed the sky and began to sink in the
west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>As he rode across a low hill, Little Eagle
caught a glimpse of trees ahead. These were
the first trees he had seen since morning. He
knew that the trees were growing beside a
stream. The horses knew it too. They quickened
their pace. Little Eagle pulled his horse
to a stop and took a long look back. There
was no sign of pursuing Crows. Evidently the
fires had fooled them and they had turned
back.</p>
<p>When Little Eagle turned to look ahead,
he smiled to himself. Angry Wolf was so eager
to reach the stream that he wasn&rsquo;t looking
back for a signal. The smile changed to a look
of alarm when he saw riders moving on the
other side of the grove of trees. Somehow
the wily Crows must have slipped around them
and were cutting them off. Then Little Eagle
caught sight of other warriors and he gave a
triumphant yell. Those riders weren&rsquo;t Crows.
They were Sioux.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Little Eagle kicked his heels against his
horse&rsquo;s sides and sent it racing around the
herd. Angry Wolf hadn&rsquo;t heard Little Eagle&rsquo;s
yell. He looked up in astonishment as Little
Eagle raced past. He took a quick look back,
but there was no one chasing Little Eagle.
When he looked ahead again, Angry Wolf saw
the Sioux. He sent his horse racing after Little
Eagle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The warriors quickly surrounded the two
boys. Little Eagle saw that it was a hunting
party under Chief Happy Otter. There were
shouts of approval from the warriors when
they saw the horses the boys had taken.</p>
<p>Little Eagle and Angry Wolf told of the
party of Crows that had been following them.
The warriors laughed and shouted when
Angry Wolf told of Little Eagle&rsquo;s plan to
make the Crows think that a large party of
Sioux were near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try to surprise those
Crows,&rdquo; Happy Otter announced. &ldquo;You boys
wait here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could go with you,&rdquo; Little Eagle suggested.
&ldquo;Our extra horses would stay here and
graze.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a true Sioux,&rdquo; Happy Otter
praised. &ldquo;But your horses are tired. We must
travel fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle nodded. He and Angry Wolf
had pushed their horses hard. If the Crows
had turned back, it would take swift, hard
riding to catch them. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair for
Angry Wolf and him to slow the Sioux war
party.</p>
<p>As soon as the warriors rode off, Angry Wolf
began to cook food for Little Eagle and himself.
Although Angry Wolf seemed to be giving
all of his attention to his task, Little Eagle
could see that his friend&rsquo;s thoughts were far
away. It wasn&rsquo;t until the meat was cooked that
Angry Wolf spoke of what was in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take new names,&rdquo; Angry Wolf
said. &ldquo;We are warriors now. We have taken
horses from the Crows and you have shot two
enemies. You may be made a medicine man.
You healed both of our wounds and you made
the plans that allowed us to escape from our
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Little Eagle gave his friend a startled look.
It was true that both of them were entitled
to be called warrior, but would he be made
a medicine man? He had never heard of a
boy of his few summers winning that honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait until we reach the winter camp,&rdquo;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you say,&rdquo; Angry Wolf agreed.</p>
<p>While Angry Wolf fixed piles of leaves for
their beds, Little Eagle searched in the grove
and the prairie nearby. It was late in the afternoon
when he returned to camp with a few
berries and some roots in his hands.</p>
<p>Angry Wolf would have liked to sit by the
fire and talk about their adventures, but Little
Eagle was tired and his wound was beginning
to throb. He crawled into the pile of leaves,
where he fell asleep at once.</p>
<p>Little Eagle didn&rsquo;t awaken in the morning
until the sun&rsquo;s rays were striking against his
eyelids. Angry Wolf was cooking meat over
the fire. He smiled briefly at Little Eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are getting lazy,&rdquo; Angry Wolf said.</p>
<p>Little Eagle gave him an answering smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work hard when we reach winter
camp,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There is much that I
want to learn from Clawing Bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Angry Wolf loafed about the camping place
while they waited for the warriors to return.
Little Eagle took his cooking pot and put
some of the berries in it. He tended the cooking
until it was finished. He poured the stuff
he had cooked into one of the bags he had
used for water. He cooked another bowlful
of a mixture of berries and the roots he had
brought into camp. When this was done, he
poured it into another bag.</p>
<p>The sun was going down when the warriors
finally returned. They weren&rsquo;t driving any
Crow ponies and they didn&rsquo;t have new Crow
scalps at their belts. As soon as the warriors
had cared for their horses and started to cook
their meal, they told what they had found.
Little Eagle saw the admiration in their eyes
as they talked to Angry Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are almost as wise as a medicine man,&rdquo;
one of the warriors told Angry Wolf. &ldquo;Your
plan of building those fires completely fooled
the Crows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;We read the trail signs,&rdquo; another warrior
explained. &ldquo;When the Crows saw the smoke
of those fires, they turned and rode away.
Truly you are a wise warrior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crows had too much of a start for
us to catch them,&rdquo; another warrior said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of the praise goes to Little Eagle,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf said, as soon as he had a chance
to speak. &ldquo;It was Little Eagle who thought of
the plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clawing Bear will be proud of his pupil,&rdquo;
Happy Otter said. &ldquo;The whole winter camp
will be proud of both of you. You have won
a great victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Little Eagle and Angry
Wolf rode with the warriors toward the winter
camp. For five suns they went on. There had
been no more snow, and most of the first snowfall
had melted so the party could go swiftly.
On the sixth morning, scouts brought word
of a herd of buffaloes to the east. Happy Otter
decided that the party would kill as many
buffaloes as could be loaded on the extra
horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>While arrangements were being made for
the hunt, Little Eagle waited excitedly. When
Happy Otter held out the straws to decide
who should have to stay in camp and tend the
horses, Little Eagle was allowed to draw with
the others. He was so proud of having a chance
to draw, just like the warriors, that he was
hardly disappointed when he drew one of the
short straws and had to tend horses with
Singing Jay.</p>
<p>As the warriors were preparing to ride out
on the hunt, Angry Wolf drew Little Eagle
aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have hunted buffalo and you never have,&rdquo;
Angry Wolf said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trade places with you.
I&rsquo;ll watch the horses while you hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a chance to draw,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was almost midday when Little Eagle and
Singing Jay took the horses to the hunters.
The warriors had killed as many buffaloes as
the horses could carry. As soon as the meat
was loaded on the pack horses, the party started
on.</p>
<p>At the end of the second day after the hunt,
there was a conference around the campfire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we shall reach the winter
camp,&rdquo; Happy Otter announced. &ldquo;The rest of
us will ride ahead to prepare a welcome. Later,
you two boys will ride into camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Little Eagle and Angry
Wolf kept their horses in a herd while the warriors
rode out of camp. As soon as the warriors
were out of sight, Little Eagle took the two
bags into which he had poured the juices he
had cooked the day he and Angry Wolf had
waited for the warriors to return from their
pursuit of the Crows. He found a small stick
and dipped it into one of the bags. With the
yellow coloring on the stick, he painted lines
on Angry Wolf&rsquo;s face. When that was finished
Angry Wolf painted lines on Little Eagle&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow for happiness,&rdquo; Angry Wolf exclaimed,
looking at the fine horses they had
taken from the Crows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And red for victory,&rdquo; Little Eagle added,
as he opened the other bag and began to put
red lines on Angry Wolf&rsquo;s face beside the
yellow ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>When they started to divide the horses into
two groups so that each could lead his captured
ponies into camp, Angry Wolf objected to
dividing them evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were the leader,&rdquo; he told Little Eagle.
&ldquo;If you had not saved my life, I couldn&rsquo;t have
returned to winter camp at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any medicine man would work to save
your life,&rdquo; Little Eagle answered. &ldquo;We took
the horses together and we&rsquo;ll divide them
equally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they reached the winter camp, a
party of warriors rode out to meet Angry Wolf
and Little Eagle. The warriors surrounded
the boys and chanted the Victory Song. The
warriors continued to circle until they neared
the first wigwam in camp. Here the warriors
changed positions so that there were men
ahead, at each side, and behind Angry Wolf
and Little Eagle. The warriors conducted the
two boys to the council wigwam. Little Eagle
noticed the admiring looks that the boys in the
camp were giving the captured horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>When the riders dismounted in front of the
council wigwam, Little Eagle turned toward
the place where Clawing Bear&rsquo;s tepee should
stand. A few paces from the tepee, he jumped
from his horse. He took the halter ropes of
the three best horses belonging to him and
stepped toward the tepee flap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Little Eagle,&rdquo; Clawing Bear
called.</p>
<p>Little Eagle stepped into the tepee. He held
the halter ropes toward Clawing Bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased,&rdquo; Clawing Bear said, as he
accepted the ropes.</p>
<p>The medicine man stepped out of the tepee
to look at the horses Little Eagle had given
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are fine horses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a
great gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle was puzzled to see that Clawing
Bear looked worried. It was odd that the medicine
man should be worried at the time his
pupil had returned with so great a victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe you much,&rdquo; Little Eagle told him.
&ldquo;I will owe you more when you have taught
me more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden smile warmed Clawing Bear&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should have known that you are a real
medicine man,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You are wise
enough to know there is more to be learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly Clawing Bear turned back into his
tepee. A moment later he returned with a
mask fashioned from the head of a buffalo
hide. The two horns had been left on the hide.
When it was worn, it looked as though the
horns grew from the medicine man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn your back to me,&rdquo; Clawing Bear
ordered.</p>
<p>Little Eagle obeyed. Slowly, Clawing Bear
lowered the mask over Little Eagle&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soaring Eagle,&rdquo; Clawing Bear said solemnly.
&ldquo;You are now a member of the sacred
clan of Sioux medicine men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Eagle gave a gasp of pleasure. Clawing
Bear had given him a medicine-man name,
Soaring Eagle. He had really been made a
medicine man. He threw his head back and
stood as straight as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many things I must learn before
I am worthy to be a medicine man,&rdquo; he said,
speaking slowly to keep his voice from trembling.
&ldquo;I will do my best to be worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have learned much,&rdquo; Clawing Bear
answered. &ldquo;You will learn more. Come, we
must report to the chiefs.&rdquo;</p>
